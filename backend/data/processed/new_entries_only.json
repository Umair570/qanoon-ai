Presently there are frequent cases of conflicting judgments.” 3The section 14-Aprovides that an offence punishable under section 13 or 14 of the Ordinance shall unless committed in respec t of Military Store~ be triable .by the Magistrate which reads as follows:- \"Section 14-A.- Certain offences triable by Magistrate.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Crim inal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898), an offence punishable under Section 13 or Section' 14 shal l, unless it has been committed in respect of any of t he arms, ammunition or military stores referred to in the proviso to the said se ction 13, be triable by a Magistrate of the first class.

It was therefore, pr oposed that when an offence triabl e by court of Sessions is connected with the case triable by Court of Magistrate under the Arms Ordinance the later case may be tried by Court of Sessi ons instead of the Magistrate. The Chairman observed that the proposed am endment in very useful whic h addresses the anomaly in trial of two connected offences and the accu sed on having acquitted by the Court of Magistrate produces copy of the judgment of his acquittal by the Magistrate under the Arms Ordinance in the Court of Sessions as a defence or a notice of circumstance going in his favour and gets acquittal or le sser punishment. After these deliberation the Commission proposed the amendment in the Arms Ordinance, 1965.",

Fraudulent preference.—(1) Where a compa ny has given preference to a person who is one of the creditors of the compa ny or a surety or guarantor for any of the debts or other liabilities of the compa ny, and the compa ny does anything or suffers anything done which has the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event of the compa ny going into liquidation, will be better than the posit ion he would have been in if that thing had not been done prior to one hundred and eighty days of commencement of winding up, the Court, if satisfied that, such transaction is a fraudulent preference may order as it may think fit for restoring the posit ion to what it would have been if the company had not given that preference. (2) If the Court is satisfied that there is a preference transfer of property, movable or immovabl e, or any delivery of goods, payment, execution made, taken or done by or against a compa ny within one hundred and eighty days before the commencement of wind ing up, the Court may order as it may think fit and may declare such transaction invalid and restore the posit ion.

Liabilities and rights of certain fraudulently preferred persons.—(1) Where, in the case of a compa ny which is being wound up, anything made or done after the commencement of this Act, is invalid under section 393 as a fraudulent preference of a person interested in property mortgaged or charged to secure the company’s debt, then (without prejudice to any rights or liabilities arising apart from this provision) the person prefer red shall be subject to the same liabilities and shall have the same rights as if he had undertaken to be personally liable as surety for the debt to the extent of the charge on the property or the value of his interest, whichever is less. (2) The value of the said person’ s interest shall be determin ed as at the date of the transaction consti tuting the fraudulent preference, and shall be determined as if the interest were free of all encumbr ances other than those to which the charge for the company’s debt was then subject. (3) On any application made to the Court with respect to any payment on the ground that the payment was a fraudulent preference of a surety or guarantor, the Court shall have jurisd iction to determine any questions with respect to the payment arising between the person to whom the payment was made and the surety or guarantor and to grant relief in respect thereof, notwi thstanding that it is not necessary so to do for the purposes of the winding up, and for that purpose may give leave to bring in the surety or guarantor as a third party as in the case of a suit for the recovery of the sum paid. (4) Sub-section (3) shall apply, with the necessary modifications, in relation to transactions other than the payment of money as it applied in relation to such payments. 395. Avoi dance of certain attachments, executions.—(1) Where any company is being wound up by or subject to the supervision of the Court, any attachment, distress or execution put in force without leave of the Court against the estate or effects or any sale held without leave of the Court of any of the properties of the compa ny after the commencement of the winding up shall be void.

CHAPTER III DUTI ES, RIGH TS AND LIABILITIES OF GUARDIANS General 20. Fiduciary relation of guardian to ward.—(1) A guardian stands in a fiduciary relation to his ward, and, save as pro vided by the will or other instru ment, if any, by which he was appoin ted, or by this Act, he must not make any profit out of his office. (2) The fiduciary relation of a guardian to his ward extends to and affects purchases by the guardian of the property of the ward, and by the ward of the property of the guardian, imme diately or soon after the ward has ceased to be a minor, and generally all transactions between them while the influence of the guardian still lasts or is recent. 21. Capacity of minors to act as guardians. A minor is incompetent to act as guardian of any minor except his own wife or child or, where he is the managing member of an undivided Hindu family, the wife or child of another minor member of that family. 22. Remuneration of guardian. —(1) A guardian appointed or declared by the Court shall be entitled to such allowance, if any, as the Court thinks fit for his care and pains in the execution of his duties. (2) When an officer of Government, as such officer, is so appointed or declared to be guardian, such fees shall be paid to the Government out of the property of the ward as the 2[provincial Government], by general or special order, directs. 1 Omitted by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration) Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s. 3 and 2nd Sch. 2 Subs. by A.O., 1937, for “L. G.”. Page 12 of 20 23. Contr ol of Collec tor as guardian. A Collector appointed or declare d by the C ourt to be guardia n of the person or property, or both, of a minor shall, in all matters connecte d with the guardianship of his ward, be subject to the control of the l[provincial Government] or of such authority as that Government, by 2notification in the official Gazette, appoints in this behalf. Guardian of the Person 24. Duties of guardian of the person. A guardian of the person of a ward is charged with the custody of the ward and must look to his support, health and education and such other matters as the law to which the ward is subject requires. 25. Title of guardian to custody of ward.—(1) If a ward leaves or is removed from the custody of a guardian of his person, the Court, if it is of opinion that it will be for the welfare of the ward to return to the custody of his guardian, may make an order for his return, and for the purpose of enforcing the order may cause the ward to be arrested and to be delivered into the custody of the guardian. (2) For the purpose of arresting the ward, the Court may exercise the power conferred on a Magistrate of the first class by section 100 of the 3[Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898] (Act V of 1898). (3) The residence of a ward against the will of his guardian with a person who is not his guardian does not of itself terminate the guardianship. 26. Removal of ward from jurisdiction.—(1) A guardian of the person appoint ed or declared by the Court, unless he is the Collector or is a guardian appoin ted by will or other instru ment, shall not, without the leave of the Court by whi ch he was appointed or declared, remove the w ard from the li mits of its jurisd iction except for such purposes as may be pr escribed. (2) The leave granted by the Court under sub-section (1) may be special or general, and may be defined by the order granting it. Guardian of Prop erty 27. Duties of guardian of property. A guardian of the property of a ward is bound to deal therewith as carefully as a man of ordinary prudence would deal with it if it were his own, and, subject to the provisions of this Chapter, he may do all acts which are reasonable and proper for the realisation, protection or benefit of the property. 28. Powers of testamentary guardian. Where a guardian has been appoin ted by will or other instru ment, his power to mortgage or charge, or transfer by sale, gift, exchange or otherwise, immoveable property belonging to his ward is subject to any restriction which may be imposed by the instru ment, unless he has under this Act been declared guardian and the Court which made the declaration permits him by an order in writin g, notwithst anding the restriction, to dispose of any immoveable property specified in the order in a manner permitted by the order. 1Subs. by A.O., 1937, for “L.

Page 13 of 20 29. Limitation of powers of guardian of property appointed or declared by the Court. Where a person other than a Collector, or than a guardian appointed by will or other instru ment, has been appointed or declared by the Court to be guardian of the property of a ward, he shall not, without the previous permission of the Court,— (a) mortgage or charge, or transfer by sale, gift, exchange or otherwise, any part of the immoveable property of his ward, or (b) lease any part of that property for a term exceeding five years or for any term extending more than one year beyond the date on which the ward will cease to be a minor. 30. Voidability of transfers made in contravention of section 28 or section 29. A dispos al of immoveable prop erty by a guardian in contravention of either of the two last foregoing sections is voidable at the instance of any other person affected thereby. 31. Practice with respect to permitting transfers under section 29.—(1) Permission to the guardian to do any of the acts mentioned in section 29 shall not be granted by the Court except in case of necessity or for an evident advantage to the ward. (2) The order granting the permission shall recite the necessity or advantage, as the case may be, describe the property with respect to whi ch the act permitted is to be done, and specify such conditions, if any, as the Court may see fit to attach to the permission; and it shall be recorded, dated and signed by the Judge of the Court with his own hand, or when from any cause he is prevented from recording the order with his own hand, shall be taken down in writing from his dictation and be dated and signed by him. (3) The Court may in its discretion attach to the permission the following among other conditions, namely:— (a) that a sale shall not be completed without the sanction of the Court; (b) that a sale shall be made to the highest bidder by public auction, before the Court or some person specially appoint ed by the Court for that purpos e, at a time and place to be specified by the Court, after such proclamation of the intended sale as the Court, subject to any rules made under this Act by the High Court, directs; (c) that a lease shall not be made in consideration of a premium or shall be made for such term of years and subject to such rents and covenants as the Court directs ; (d) that the whole or any part of the proceeds of the act permitted shall be paid into the Court by the guardian, to be disburs ed therefrom or to be invested by the Court on prescribed securities or to be otherwise disposed of as the Court directs. (4) Before granting permission to a guardian to do an act mentioned in section 29, the Court may cause notice of the application for the permission to be given to any relative or friend of the ward who should, in its opinion, receive notice thereof, and shall hear and record the statement of any person who appears in oppos ition to the application. Page 14 of 20 32. Variation of powers of guardian of property appointed or declared by the Court. Where a guardian of the property of a ward has been appoin ted or declared by the Court and such guardian is not the Collector, the Court may, from time to time, by order, define, restrict or extend his powers with respect to the property of the ward in such manner and to such extent as it may consider to be for the advantage of the ward and consistent with the law to which the ward is subject. 33.

Suit against guardian where administration bond was not taken.—(1) Where a guardian appoin ted or declared by the Court has not given a bond as aforesaid, any person, with the leave of the Court, may, as next friend, at any time during the contin uance of the minority of the ward, and upon such terms as aforesaid, institute a suit against the guardian, or, in case of his death, against his representative, for an account of what the guardian has received in respect of the property of the ward, and may recover in the suit, as trust ee for the ward, such amount as may be found to be payable by the guardian or his representative, as the case may be. 2* * * * * * * 37.

Discharge of guardian.—(1) If a guardian appoin ted or declared by the Court desires to resign his office, he may apply to the Court to be discharged. (2) If the Court finds that there is suf ficient reason for the application, it shall discharge him, and if the guardian the application is the Collector and the l[Provincial Government] approves of is applying to be discharged, the Court shall in any case discharge him. 41.

(4) When he has delivered the property or accounts as required by the Court, the Court may declare him to be discharged from his liabilities save as regards any fraud which may subsequently be discovered. 42. Appointment of successor to guardian dead, discharged or removed. When a guardian appoint ed or declared by the Court is discharged, or, under the law to which the ward is subj ect, ceases to be entitled to act, or wh en any such guardian or a guardian appoin ted by will or ot her instru ment is removed or di es, the Court, of its own motion or on application under Chapter II, may, if the ward is still a minor, appoint or declare another guardian of his person or property, or both, as the case may be.

(3) Except where it appears that the object of making an order under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) would be defeated by the delay, the Court shall, before making the order, direct notice of the application therefor or of the intention of the Court to make it, as the case may be, to be given, in a case under sub-section (1), to the guardian or, in a case under sub-section (2), to the guardian who has not made the application. (4) In case of disobedience to an order made under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the order may be enforced in the same manner as an injunction granted under l[rules 1 and 2 of order XXXIX of the First Schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908] (Act V of 1908) in a case under sub-section (1), as if the ward were the plaintiff and the guardian were the defendant or, in a case under sub-section (2), as if the guardian who made the application were the plaintiff and the other guardian were the defendant.

Explanation. The fact that the appellant or applicant was misled by any order, practice or judgment of the High Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period of limitation may be sufficient cause within the meaning of this section. 3* * * * * * * 6. Legal disability. (1) Where a person entitled to institute a suit 4[or proceeding] or make an application for the execution of a decree is, at the time from which the period of limitation is to be reckoned, a minor, or insane, or an idiot, he may institute the suit 4[or proceeding] or make the application within the same period after the disability has ceased, as would otherwise have been allowed from the time prescribed therefore in the third column of the first schedule 1[or in section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908)]. (2) Where such person is, at the time from which the period of limitation is to be reckoned, affecte d by two such disabilities, or where, before his disability has ceased, he is affected by another disability, he may institute the suit or make the application within the same period, after both disabilities have ceased, as would otherwise have been allowed from the time so prescribed. (3) Where the disability continues up to the death of such person, his legal representative may institute the suit or make the application within the same period after the death as would otherwise have been allowed from the time so prescribed. (4) Where such representative is at the date of the death affected by any such disability, the rules contained in sub -sections (1) and (2) shall apply. Illustrations (a) The right to sue for the hire of a boat accrues to A during his min ority. He attains majority four years after such accruer. He may institute his suit at any time within three years from the date of his attaining majority . (b) A right to sue accrues to Z during his minority. After the accruer, but while Z is still a minor, h e becomes insane. Time runs against Z from the date when his insanity and minority cease. (c) A right to sue accrues to X during his minority.

I. p. 258. 4lns. by Ord. 43 of 1962, s. 3. Page 6 of 47 7. Disability of one of several plaintiffs or applicants. Where one of several persons jointly entitled to institute a suit 1[or proceeding] or make an application for the execution of a decree is under any such disability, and a discharge can be given without the concurrence of such person, time will run against them all: but, where no such discharge can be given, time will not run as against any of them until one of them becomes capable of giving such discharge without the concurrence of the others or until the disability has ceased. Illustrations (a) A incurs a debt to a firm of which B, C an d D are partners. B is insane, and C is a minor. D can give a discharge of the debt without the concurrence or B and C. Time runs against B, C and D. (b) A incurs a debt to a firm of which E, F and G are partners. E and F are insane, and G is a minor. Time will not run against any of them until either E or F becomes sane, or G attains majority. 28. Special exceptions. Nothing in section 6 or in section 7 applies to suits to enforce rights of pre -emption, or shall be deemed to extend, for more than three years from the cessation of the disability or the death of the person affected thereby, the period within which any suit must be instituted or application made. Illustrations (a) A, to whom a right to sue for a legacy has accrued during his minority, attains majority eleven years after such accruer. A has, under the ordinary law, only one year remaining within which to sue. But under section 6 and this section an extension of two years will be allowed him, making in all a period of three years from the date o f his attaining majority, within which he may bring his suit. (b) A right to sue for an hereditary office accrues to A who at the time is insane. Six years after the accruer A recovers his reason. A has six years, under the ordinary law, from the date when his insanity ceased within which to institute a suit. No extension of time will be given him under section 6 read with this section. (c) A right to sue as landlord to recover possession from a tenant accrues to A, who is an idiot. A dies three years after the accruer, his idiocy continuing up to the date of his death. A’s representative in interest has, under the ordinary law, nine years from the date of A’s death within which to bring a suit. Section 6 read with this section does not extend that time, except where the representative is himself under disability when the representation devolves upon him. 1Ins. by the Limitation (Amdt.) Ordinance, 1962 (43 of 1962), s. 3. 2 Ins. by the Indian Limitation (Amdt.) Act, 1929 (1 of 1929),s.2. Page 7 of 47 9. Continuous running of time. Where once time has begun to run, no subsequent dis - ability or inability to sue stops it : Provided that where letters of administration to the estate of a creditor have been granted to his debtor, the running of the time pres cribed for a suit to recover the debt shall be suspended while the administration continues. 10.

O., 1949 . 3 Subs. by the Central Laws (Statute Reform) Ordinance, 1960 (21 of 1960 ), s. 3 and 2nd Sch., (with effect from the 14th October, 1955 ), for the original sub‑section (2) as amended by A. O.,1949 , and the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration) Act, 1951 (26 of 1951 ), s. 8. UNDER PROOF READING Page 6 of 24 CHAPTER II THE NATURE OF PARTNERSHIP 4. Definition of “partnership”, “partner”, “firm” and “firm name”.— “Partnership” is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all. Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are called individually “partners” and collectively “a firm”, and the name under which their business is carried on is called the “firm name”. 5. Partnership not created by status.— The relation of partnership arises from contract and not from status ; and, in particular, the members of a Hindu und ivided family carrying on a family business as such, or a Burmese Buddh ist husband and wife carrying on business as such are not partners in such business. 6. Mode of determining existence of partnership.— In determining whether a group of persons is or is not a firm, or whether a person is or is not a partner in a firm, regard shall be had to the real relation between the parties, as shown by all relevant facts taken together. Explanation 1.—The sharing of profits or of gross returns arising from property by persons holding a joint or common interest in that property does not of itself make such persons partners. Explanation 2.—The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business, or of a payment contingent upon the earning of profits or varying with the profits earned by a business, does not of itself make him a partner with the persons carrying on the business ; and in particular, the receipt of such share or payment— (a) by a lender of money to persons engaged or about to engage in any bu siness, (b) by a servant or agent as remuneration, (c) by the widow or child of a deceased partner, as annun ity, or (d) by a previous owner or part owner of the business, as consideration for the sale of the goodwill or share thereof, does not of itself make the receiver a partner with the persons carrying on the business. 1[6A. Act not to apply to certain relationships. — Nothing contained in thi s Act not to apply to certain relationships. Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to a relationship created by any agreement between a banking company and a person or group of persons prov iding for sharing of profit and losses arising from or relating to the provision by the banking company of f inance to such person or group of p ersons.

Persons competent to transfer. —Every person competent to contract and e ntitled to transferable property, or authorized to dispose of transferable property not his own, is competent to transfer such property either wholly or in part, and either absolutely or conditionally, in the circumstances, to the extent and in the manner allowed and prescribed by any law for the time being in force. 8. Operation of transfer. —Unless a different intention is expressed or necessarily implied, a transfer of property passes forthwith to the transferee all the interest which the transferor is th en capable of passing in the property, and in the legal incidents thereof. Such incidents include, where the property is land, the easements annexed thereto, the rents and profits thereof accruing after the transfer, and all things attached to the earth; and, where the property is machinery attached to the earth, the moveable parts thereof; and, where the property is a house, the easements annexed thereto, the rent thereof accruing after the transfer, and the locks, keys, bars, doors, windows, and all other things provided for permanent use therewith; and, where the property is a debt or other actionable claim, the securities therefor (except where they are also for other debts or claims not transferred to the transferee), but not arrears of interest accrued before the transfer; and, where the property is money or other property yielding income, the interest or income thereof accruing after the transfer takes effect. 9. Oral transfer. —A transfer of property may be made without writing in every case in which a writing is not expressly required by law. 10. Condition restraining alienation. —Where property is transferred subject to a condition or limitation absolutely restraining the transferee or any person claiming under him from parting with or disposing of his interest in the property, the condition or limitation is void, except in the case of a lease where the condition is for the benefit of the lessor or those claiming under him: Provided that property may be transferred to or for the benefit of a woman (not being a Hindu, 3[Muslim] or Buddhist), so that she shall not have power during her marriage to transfer or charge the same or her beneficial interest therein. 1Subs. by Act No. II of 1900 , s. 3 (ii) . 2Ins. by Act No. III of 1885 , s. 4. 3Subs. by the Federal Adaptation of Laws Order, 1975 (President’s Order No. 4 of 1975) , Art. 2 and Table. Page 13 of 56 11. Restriction repugnant to interest created. —Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created absolutely in favour of any person, but the terms of the transfer direct that such interest shall be applied or enjoyed by him in a particular manner, he shall be entitled to receive and dispose of such interest as if there were no such direction. 1[Where any such direction has been made in respect of one piece of immoveable property for the purpose of securing the beneficial enjoyment of another piece of such property, nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect any right which the transferor may have to enforce such direction or any r emedy which he may have in respect of a breach thereof.] 12. Condition making interest determinable on insolvency or attempted alienation. — where property is transferred subject to a condition or limitation making any interest therein, reserved or given to or for the benefit of any person, to cease on his becoming insolvent or endeavouring to transfer or dispose of the same, such condition or limitation is void. Nothing in this section applies to a condition in a lease for the benefit of the lessor or those claiming under him. 13. Transfer for benefit of unborn person. —Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the b enefit of a person not in existence at the date of the transfer, subject to a prior interest created by the same transfer, the interest created for the benefit of such person shall not take effect, unless it extends to the whole of the remaining interest o f the transferor in the property. Illustration A transfers property of which he is the owner to B in trust for A and his intended wife successively for their lives, and, after the death of the survivor, for the eldest son of the intended marriage for life, and after his death for A’s second son. The interest so created for the benefit of the eldest son does not take effect, because it does not extend to the whole of A’s remaining interest in the property. 14. Rule against perpetuity. — No transfer of p roperty can operate to create an interest which is to take effect after the life­time of one or more persons living at the date of such transfer, and the minority of some person who shall be in existence at the expiration of that period, and to whom, if he attains full age, the interest created is to belong. 15. Transfer to class some of whom come under sections 13 and 14. — If, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a class of persons with regard to some of whom such i nterest fails by reason of any of the rules contained in sections 13 and 14, such interest fails 1[in regard to those persons only and not in regard to the whole class]. 1[16. Transfer to take effect on failure of prior interest. — Where, by reason of any of the rules contained in sections 13 and 14, an interest created for the benefit of a person or of a class of persons fails in regard to such person or the whole of such class, any interest created in the same transaction and inte nded to take effect after or upon failure of such prior interest also fails. 17. Direction for accumulation .— (1) Where the terms of a transfer of property direct that the income arising from the property shall be accumulated either wholly or in part duri ng a period longer than__ (a) the life of the transferor, or (b) a period of eighteen years from the date of the transfer, such direction shall, save as hereinafter provided, be void to the extent to which the period during which the accumulation is directed exceeds the longer of the aforesaid periods, and at the end of such last­mentioned period the property and the income th ereof shall be disposed of as if the period during which the accumulation has been directed to be made had elapsed. 1Subs. by Act No. XX of 1929, ss. 8-10. Page 14 of 56 (2) This section shall not affect any direction for accumulation for the purpose of__ (i) the paym ent of the debts of the transferor or any other person taking any interest under the transfer, or (ii) the provision of portions for children or remoter issue of the transferor or of any other person taking any interest under the transfer, or (iii) the pre servation or maintenance of the property transferred; and such direction may be made accordingly. 18. Transfer in perpetuity for benefit of public. — The restrictions in sections 14, 16 and 17 shall not apply in the case of a transfer of property for the benefit of the public in the advancement of religion, knowledge, commerce, health, safety, or any other object beneficial to mankind.] 19. Vested inte rest.—Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of a person without specifying the time when it is to take effect, or in terms specifying that it is to take effect forthwith or on the happening of an event which must happen , such interest is vested, unless a contrary intention appears from the terms of the transfer. A vested interest is not defeated by the death of the transferee before he obtains possession. Explanation .__ An intention that an interest shall not be vested i s not to be inferred merely from a provision whereby the enjoyment thereof is postponed, or whereby a prior interest in the same property is given or reserved to some other person, or whereby income arising from the property is directed to be accumulated u ntil the time of enjoyment arrives, or from a provision that if a particular event shall happen the interest shall pass to another person. 20. When unborn person acquires vested interest on transfer for his benefit. —Where, on a transfer of property, an int erest therein is created for the benefit of a person not then living, he acquires upon his birth, unless a contrary intention appear from the terms of the transfer, a vested interest, although he may not be entitled to the enjoyment thereof immediately on his birth. 21. Contingent interest. —Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of a person to take effect only on the happening of a specified uncertain event, or if a specified uncertain event shall not happen, such person thereby acquires a contingent interest in the property. Such interest becomes a vested interest, in the former case, on the happening of the event, in the latter, when the happening of the event becomes impossible. Exception .__Where, under a transfer of property, a person becomes entitled to an interest therein upon attaining a particular age, and the transferor also gives to him absolutely the income to arise from such interest before he reaches that age, or directs the income or so much ther eof as may be necessary to be applied for his benefit, such interest is not contingent. 22. Transfer to members of a class who attain a particular age. —Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of such members only of a class as shall attain a particular age, such interest does not vest in any member of the class who has not attained that age. Page 15 of 56 23. Transfer contingent on happening of specified uncertain event. —Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is to accrue to a specified person if a specified uncertain event shall happen, and no time is mentioned for the occurrence of that event, the interest fails unle ss such event happens before, or at the same time as, the intermediate or precedent interest ceases to exist. 24. Transfer to such of certain persons as survive at some period not specified. —Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is to accru e to such of certain persons as shall be surviving at some period, but the exact period is not specified, the interest shall go to such of them as shall be alive when the intermediate or precedent interest ceases to exist, unless a contrary intention appea rs from the terms of the transfer. Illustration A transfers property to B for life, and after his death to C and D, equally to be divided between them, or to the survivor of them. C dies during the life of B. D survives B. At B’s death the property passes to D. 25. Conditional transfer. —An interest created on a transfer of property and dependent upon a condition fails if the fulfilment of the condition is impossible, or is forbidden by law, or is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law, or is fraudulent, or involves or implies injury to the person or property of another, or the Court regards it as immoral or opposed to public policy. Illustrations (a) A lets a farm to B on condition that he shall walk a hundred miles in an hour. The lease is void. (b) A gives Rs. 500 to B on condition that he shall marry A’s daughter C. At the date of the transfer C was dead. The transfer is void. (c) A transfers Rs. 500 to B on condition that she shall murder C. The tran sfer is void. (d) A transfers Rs. 500 to his niece C if she will desert her husband. The transfer is void. 26. Fulfilment of condition precedent. —Where the terms of a transfer of property impose a condition to be fulfilled before a person can take an inter est in the property, the condition shall be deemed to have been fulfilled if it has been substantially complied with. Illustrations (a) A transfers Rs. 5,000 to B on condition that he shall marry with the consent of C, D and E. E dies. B marries with the consent of C and D. B is deemed to have fulfilled the condition. (b) A transfers Rs. 5,000 to B on condition that he shall marry with the consent of C, D and E. B marries without the consent of C, D and E, but obtains their consent after the marriage. B has not fulfilled the condition. Page 16 of 56 27. Conditional transfer to one person coupled with transfer to another on failure of prior disposition. — Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of one person, and by the same transaction an ulterior disposition of the same interest is made in favour of another, if the prior disposition under the transfer shall fail, the ulterior disposition shall take effect upon the failure of the prior disposition, although the failure may not have occurred in the manner contemplated by the transferor. But, where the intention of the parties to the transaction is that the ult erior disposition shall take effect only in the event of the prior disposition failing in a particular manner, the ulterior disposition shall not take effect unless the prior disposition fails in that manner. Illustrations (a) A transfers Rs. 500 to B on c ondition that he shall execute a certain lease within three months after A’s death, and, if he should neglect to do so, to C. B dies in A’s life­time. The disposition in favour of C takes effect. (b) A transfers property to his wife; but, in case she shou ld die in his life­time, transfers to B that which he had transferred to her. A and his wife perish together, under circumstances which make it impossible to prove that she died before him. The disposition in favour of B does not take effect. 28. Ulterior transfer conditional on happening or not happening of specified event. — On a transfer of property an interest therein may be created to accrue to any person with the condition superadded that in case a specified uncertain event shall happen such interest s hall pass to another person, or that in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen such interest shall pass to another person. In each case the dispositions are subject to the rules contained in sections 10, 12, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 27. 29. Fulfil ment of condition subsequent. —An ulterior disposition of the kind contemplated by the last preceding section cannot take effect unless the condition is strictly fulfilled. Illustration A transfers Rs. 500 to B, to be paid to him on his attaining his majority or marrying, with a proviso that, if B dies a minor or marries without C’s consent, the Rs. 500 shall go to D. B marries when only 17 years of age, without C’s consent. The transfer to D takes effect. 30. Prior disposition not affected by inva lidity of ulterior disposition. —If the ulterior disposition is not valid, the prior disposition is not affected by it. Illustration A transfers a farm to B for her life, and, if she do not desert her husband, to C. B is entitled to the farm during her life as if no condition had been inserted. 31. Condition that transfer shall cease to have effect in case specified uncertain event happens or does not happen. — Subject to the provisions of section 12, on a transfer of property an interest therein may be created with the condition superadded that it shall cease to exist in case a specified uncertain event shall happen, or in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen. Page 17 of 56 Illustrations (a) A transfers a farm to B for his life, with a proviso that, in case B cuts down a certain wood, the transfer shall cease to have any effect. B cuts down the wood. He loses his life­interest in the farm. (b) A transfers a farm to B, provided that, if B shall not go to England within three years after the date of the transfer, his interest in the farm shall cease. B does not go to England within the term prescribed. His interest in the farm ceases. 32. Such condition must not be invalid. — In order that a condition that an interest shall cease to exist may be valid, it is necessary that the event to which it relates be one which could legally constitute the condition of the creation of an interest. 33. Transfer conditional on per formance of act, no time being specified for performance. — Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created subject to a condition that the person taking it shall perform a certain act, but no time is specified for the performance of the act, the condition is broken when he renders impossible, permanently or for an indefinite period, the performance of the act. 34. Transfer conditional on performance of act, time being specified. —Where an act is to be performed by a person either as a condition to be fulfilled before an interest created on a transfer of property is enjoyed by him, or as a condition on the non­fulfilment of which the interest is to pass from him to another person, a nd a time is specified for the performance of the act, if such performance within the specified time is prevented by the fraud of a person who would be directly benefited by non­fulfilment of the condition, such further time shall as against him be allowed for performing the act as shall be requisite to make up for the delay caused by such fraud. But if no time is specified for the performance of the act, then, if its performance is by the fraud of a person interested in the non­fulfilment of the condition rendered impossible or indefinitely postponed, the condition shall as against him be deemed to have been fulfilled. Election 35. Election when necessary. —Where a person professes to transfer property which he has no right to transfer, and as part of the sa me transaction confers any benefit on the owner of the property, such owner must elect either to confirm such transfer or to dissent from it; and in the latter case he shall relinquish the benefit so conferred, and the benefit so relinquished shall revert to the transferor or his representative as if it had not been disposed of, Subject nevertheless, where the transfer is gratuitous, and the transferor has, before the election, died or otherwise become incapable of making a fresh transfer, and in all cases where the transfer is for consideration, to the charge of making good to the disappointed transferee the amount or value of the property attempted to be transferred to him. Page 18 of 56 Illustrations The farm of l[Ulipur] is the property of C and worth Rs. 800. A by an instrument of gift professes to transfer it to B, giving by the same instrument Rs. 1,000 to C. C elects to retain the farm. He forfeits the gift of Rs. 1,000. In the same case, A dies before the election. His representative must out of the Rs. 1,000 pay Rs. 800 to B. The rule in the first paragraph of this section applies whether the transferor does or does not believe that which he professes to transfer to be his own. A person taking no benefit directly under a transaction, but deriving a benefit un der it indirectly, need not elect. A person who in his one capacity takes a benefit under the transaction may in another dissent therefrom. Exception to the last preceding four rules .__ Where a particular benefit is expressed to be conferred on the owner of the property which the transferor professes to transfer, and such benefit is expressed to be in lieu of that property, if such owner claim the property, he must relinquish the particular benefit, but he is not bound to relinquish any other ben efit conferred upon him by the same transaction. Acceptance of the benefit by the person on whom it is conferred constitutes an election by him to confirm the transfer, if he is aware of his duty to elect and of those circumstances which would influence th e judgment of a reasonable man in making an election, or if he waives enquiry into the circumstances. Such knowledge or waiver shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be presumed, if the person on whom the benefit has been conferred has enjoyed it for two years without doing any act to express dissent. Such knowledge or waiver may be inferred from any act of his which renders it impossible to place the persons interested in the property professed to be transferred in the same condition as if suc h act had not been done. Illustration A transfers to B an estate to which C is entitled, and as part of the same transaction gives C a coal­mine. C takes possession of the mine and exhausts it. He has thereby confirmed the transfer of the estate to B. If he does not within one year after the date of the transfer signify to the transferor or his representatives his intention to confirm or to dissent from the transfer, the transferor or his representatives may, upon the expiration of that period, require him to make his election; and, if he does not comply with such requisition within a reasonable time after he has received it, he shall be deemed to have elected to confirm the transfer. 1Subs. by the Central Laws (St atute Reform) Ordinance, 1960 ( Ordinance No . XXI of 1960), s. 3 and 2nd Sch. (with effect from the 14th October, 1956 ). Page 19 of 56 In case of disability, the election shall be postponed until the disability ceases, or until the election is made by some competent authority. Apportionment 36. Apportionment of periodical payments on determination of interest of person entitled. — In the absence of a contract or local usage to the contrary, all rents, annuities, pensions, dividends and other periodical payments in the nature of income shall, upon the transfer of the interest of the person entitled to receive such payments, be deemed, as between the transferor and the transferee, to accrue due from day to day, and to be apportionable accordingly, but to be payable on the days appointed for the payme nt thereof. 37. Apportionment of benefit of obligation on severance. —When, in consequence of a transfer, property is divided and held in several shares, and thereupon the benefit of any obligation relating to the property as a whole passes from one to seve ral owners of the property, the corresponding duty shall, in the absence of a contract to the contrary amongst the owners, be performed in favour of each of such owners in proportion to the value of his share in the property, provided that the duty can be served and that the severance does not substantially increase the burden of the obligation; but if the duty cannot be severed, or if the severance would substantially increase the burden of the obligation, the duty shall be performed for the benefit of suc h one of the several owners as they shall jointly designate for that purpose: Provided that no person on whom the burden of the obligation lies shall be answerable for failure to discharge it in manner provided by this section, unless and until he has had reasonable notice of the severance. Nothing in this section applies to leases for agricultural purposes unless and until the l[Provincial Government] by notification in the official Gazette so directs. Illustrations (a) A sells to B, C and D a house situat e in a village and leased to E at an annual rent of Rs. 30 and delivery of one fat sheep, B having provided half the purchase­money and C and D one­quarter each. E, having notice of this, must pay Rs. 15 to B, Rs. 7­1/2 to C, and Rs. 7­1/2 to D, and must d eliver the sheep according to the joint direction of B, C and D. (b) In the same case, each house in the village being bound to provide ten days' labour each year on a dyke to prevent inundation, E had agreed as a term of his lease to perform this work for A. B, C and D severally require E to perform the ten days’ work due on account of the house of each. E is not bound to do more than ten days’ work in all, according to such directions as B, C and D may join in giving. (B)Transfer of Immoveable Property 38. Transfer by person authorized only under certain circumstances to transfer. — Where any person, authorized only under circumstances in their nature variable to dispose of immoveable property, transfers such property for consideration, alleging the existence of such circumstances, they 1Subs. by A.O., 1937. Page 20 of 56 shall, as between the transferee on the one part and the transferor and other persons (if any) affected by the transfer on the other part, be deemed to have existed, if the transferee, after using reasonable care to ascertain the existence of such circumstances, has acted in good faith. Illustration A, a Hindu widow, whose husband has left collateral heirs, alleging that the property held by her as such is insufficient for her maintenance, agrees, for purposes neither religious nor charitable, to sell a field, part of such property, to B. B satisfies himself by reasonable enquiry that the income of the property is insufficient for A’s maintenance, and that the sale of the field is necessary, and, acting in good faith, buys the field from A. As between B on the one part and A and the collateral heirs on the other part, a necessit for the sale shall be deemed to have existed. 39. Transfer where third person is entitled to maintenance. —Where a third person has a right to receive maintenance, or a provision for advancement or marriage, from the profits of immoveable property, and such property is transferred 1[* * * ], the right may be enforced against the transferee, if he has notice 1[thereof] or if the transfer is gratuitous; but not against a transferee for consideration and without notice of the right, nor against such property in his hands. 1[* * * * * * *] 40. Burden of obligation imposing restriction on use of land, or of obligation annexed to ownership but not amounting to interest or easement. —Where, for the more beneficial enjoyment of his own immoveable property, a third person has, independently of any interest in the immoveable property of another or of any easement thereon, a right to restrain the enjoyment 1[in a particular manner of the latter property], or Where a third person is entitled to the benefit of an obligation arising out of contract and annexed to the ownership of immoveable property, but not amounting to an inter est therein or easement thereon, such right or obligation may be enforced against a transferee with notice thereof or a gratuitous transferee of the property affected thereby, but not against a transferee for consideration and without notice of the right o r obligation, nor against such property in his hands. Illustration A contracts to sell 2[Ulipur] to B. While the contract is still in force he sells 2[Ulipur] to C, who has notice of the contract. B may enforce the contract against C to the same extent as against A. 41. Transfer by ostensible owner. —Where, with the consent, express or implied, of the persons interested in immoveable property, a person is the ostensible owner of such property and transfers the same for consideration, the transfer s hall not be voidable on the ground that the transferor was not authorized to make it: provided that the transferee, after taking reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor had power to make the transfer, has acted in good faith. 1Rep. and subs. by Act No. XX of 1929 , ss. 11 -12. 2Subs. by the Central Laws (Statute Reform) Ordinance, 1960 ( Ordinance No. XXI of 1960), s.3 and 2nd Sch. (with effect from the 14th October, 1956 ). Page 21 of 56 42. Transfer by person having authority to revoke former transfer. —Where a person transfers any immoveable property reserving power to revoke the transfer, and subsequently transfers the property for consideration to another transferee, such transfer operates in favour of such transferee (subject to any condition attached to the exercise of the power) as a revocation of the former transfer to the extent of the power. Illustration A lets a house to B, and reserves power to revoke the lease if, in the opinion of a specified surveyor, B should make a use of it detrimental to its value. Afterwards A, thinking that such a use has been made, lets the house to C. This operates as a revocation of B’s lease subject to the opinion of the surveyor as to B’s use of the house having been detrimental to its value. 43. Tran sfer by unauthorized person who subsequently acquires interest in property transferred. —Where a person 1[fraudulently or] erroneously represents that he is authorized to transfer certain immoveable property and professes to transfer such property for consi deration, such transfer shall, at the option of the transferee, operate on any interest which the transferor may acquire in such property at any time during which the contract of transfer subsists. Nothing in this section shall impair the right of transfer ees in good faith for consideration without notice of the existence of the said option. Illustration A, a Hindu, who has separated from his father B, sells to C three fields, X, Y and Z, representing that A is authorized to transfer the same. Of these fields Z does not belong to A, it having been retained by B on the partition; but on B’s dying A as heir obtains Z. C, not having rescinded the contract of sale, may require A to deliver Z to him. 44. Transfer by one co­owner. — Where one of two or more co­owners of immoveable property legally competent in that behalf transfers his share of such property or an y interest therein, the transferee acquires, as to such share or interest, and so far as is necessary to give effect to the transfer, the transferor’s right to joint possession or other common or part enjoyment of the property, and to enforce a partition of the same, but subject to the conditions and liabilities affecting, at the date of the transfer, the share or interest so transferred. Where the transferee of a share of a dwelling­house belonging to an undivided family is not a member of the family, no thing in this section shall be deemed to entitle him to joint possession or other common or part enjoyment of the house. 45. Joint transfer for consideration. —Where immoveable property is transferred for consideration to two or more persons, and such consi deration is paid out of a fund belonging to them in common, they are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, respectively entitled to interests in such property identical, as nearly as may be, with the interests to which they were respectively entit led in the fund; and, where such consideration is paid out of separate funds belonging to them respectively, they are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, respectively entitled to interest in such property in proportion to the shares of the consi deration which they respectively advanced. 1Ins. by Act No. XX of 1929 , s. 13. Page 22 of 56 In the absence of evidence as to the interests in the fund to which they were respectively entitled, or as to the shares which they respectively advanced, such persons shall be presumed to be equally interested in the property. 46. Transfer for consideration by persons having distinct interests. —Where immoveable property is transferred for consideration by persons having distinct interests therein, the transferors are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, entitled to share in the consideration equally, where their interest in the property were of equal value, and, where such interests were of unequal value, proportionately to the value of their respective interests . Illustrations (a) A, owning a moiety, and B and C each a quarter share, of mauza 1[Ulipur], exchange an eighth share of that mauza for a quarter share of mauza 1[Mithapukur]. There being no agreement to the contrary, A is entitled to an eighth share in 1[Mithapukur], and B and C each to a sixteenth share in that mauza. (b) A, being entitled to a life­interest in mauza 1[Jalkothi] and B and C to the reversion, sell the mauza for Rs. 1,000. A’s life­interest is ascertained to be worth Rs. 600, the reversion Rs. 400. A is entitled to receive Rs. 600 out of the purchase­money, B and C to receive Rs. 400. 47. Transfer by co­owner of share in common property. —Where several co­owners of immoveable property transfer a share therein without specifying that the transfer is to take effect on any particular share or shares of the transferors, the transfer, as among such transferors, takes effect on such shares equally where the shares were equal, and, where they were unequal, proportionately to the extent of such shares. Illustration A, the owner of an eight­anna share, and B and C, each the owner of a four­anna share, in mauza 1[Ulipur], transfer a two­anna share in the mauza to D, withou t specifying from which of their several shares the transfer is made. To give effect to the transfer one­anna share is taken from the share of A, and half an anna share from each of the shares of B and C. 48. Priority of rights created by transfer. —Where a person purports to create by transfer at different times rights in or over the same immoveable property, and such rights cannot all exist or be exercised to their full extent together, each later created right shall, in the absence of a special contract or reservation binding the earlier transferees, be subject to the rights previously created. 49. Transferee’s right under policy .—Where immoveable property is transferred for consideration, and such property or any part thereof is at the date of the transfe r insured against loss or damage by fire, the transferee, in case of such loss or damage, may, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, require any money which the transferor actually receives under the policy, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to be applied in reinstating the property. 1Subs. by the Central Laws (St atute Reform) Ordinance, 1960 ( Ordinance No. XXI of 1960), s s. 3-4 and 2nd Sch. (with effect from the 14th October, 1956 ). Page 23 of 56 50. Rent bona­fide paid to holder under defective title. —No person shall be chargeable with any rents or profits of any immoveable property, which he has in good faith paid or delivered to any person of whom he in good faith held such property, notwithstanding it may afterw ards appear that the person to whom such payment or delivery was made had no right to receive such rents or profits.

A contract for the sale of immoveable proper ty is a contract that a sale of such property shall take place on terms settled between the parties. It does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such property. 55. Rights and liabilities of buyer and seller. —In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the buyer and the seller of immoveable property respectively are subject to the liabilities, and have the rights, mentioned in the rules next following, or such of them as are applicable to the property sold: (1) The seller is bound — (a) to disclose to the buyer any material defect in the property 2[or in the seller’s title thereto] of which the seller is, and the buyer is not, aware, and which the buyer could not with ordinary care discover; (b) to produce to the buyer on his request for exam ination all documents of title relating to the property which are in the seller’s possession or power; (c) to answer to the best of his information all relevant questions put to him by the buyer in respect to the property or the title thereto; (d) on payme nt or tender of the amount due in respect of the price, to execute a proper conveyance of the property when the buyer tenders it to him for execution at a proper time and place; (e) between the date of the contract of sale and the delivery of the property, to take as much care of the property and all documents of title relating thereto which are in his possession as an owner of ordinary prudence would take of such property and documents; (f) to give, on being so required, the buyer, or such person as he directs, such possession of the property as its nature admits; (g) to pay all public charges and rent accrued due in respect of the property up to the date of the sale, the interest on all incumbrances on such property due on such date, and, e xcept where the property is sold subject to incumbrances, to discharge all incumbrances on the property then existing.

These paragraphs extend to every cantonment in the Provinces, etc., see s. 287 of the Cantonments Act, 1924 ( Act No. II of 1924). 2Ins. by Act No. VI of 1929 , s. 17. Page 26 of 56 Provided that, where the sale is made by a person in a fiduciary character, he shall be deemed to contract with the buyer that the seller has done no act whereby the property is incumbered or whereby he is hindered from transferring it. The benefit of the contract mentioned in this rule shall be annexed to, and shall go with, the interest of the transferee as such, and may be enforced by every person in whom that interest is for the whole or any part thereof from time to time vested. (3) Where the whole of the purchase­money has been paid to the seller, he is also bound to deliver to the buyer all documents of title relating to the property which are in the seller’s possession or power: Provided that, (a) where the seller retains any part of the property comprised in such documents, he is entitled to retain them all, and, (b) where the whole of such property is sold to different buyers, the buyer of the lot of greatest value is entitled to such documents. But in case (a) the seller, and in case (b) the buyer, of the lot of greatest value, is bound, upon every reasonable request by the buyer, or by any of the other buyers, as the case may be, and at the cost of the person making the request, to produce the said documents and furnish such true copies thereof or extracts therefrom as he may require; and in the mean time, the seller, or the buyer of the lot of greatest value, as the case may be, shall keep the said documents safe, uncancelled and undefaced, unless prevented from so doing by fire or other inevitable accident. (4) The seller is entitled__ (a) to the rents and profits of the property till the ownership thereof passes to the buyer; (b) where the ownership of the property has passed to the buyer before payment of the whole of the purchase­mon ey, to a charge upon the property in the hands of the buyer 1[any transferee without consideration or any transferee with notice of the non­payment], for the amount of the purchase­money, or any part thereof remaining unpaid, and for interest on such amoun t or part 1[from the date on which possession has been delivered]. (5) The buyer is bound__ (a) to disclose to the seller any fact as to the nature or extent of the seller’s interest in the property of which the buyer is aware but of which he has reason t o believe that the seller is not aware, and which materially increases the value of such interest; (b) to pay or tender, at the time and place of completing the sale, the purchase­money to the seller or such person as he directs: Provided that, where the property is sold free from incumbrances, the buyer may retain out of the purchase­money the amount of any incumbrances on the property existing at the date of the sale, and shall pay the amount so retained to the persons entitled thereto; 1Ins. by Act No. XX of 1929 , s. 17.

An omission to make such disclosures as are mentioned in this section, paragraph (1), clause (a), and paragraph (5), clause (a), is fraudulent. 1[56. Marshalling by subsequent purchaser. —If the owner of two or more properties mortgages them to one person and then sells one or more of the properties to another person, the buyer is, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, entitled to have the mortgage­debt satisfied out of the property or properties not sold to him, so far as the same will extend, but not so as to prejudice the rights of the mortgagee or persons claiming under him or of any other person who has for consideration acquired an interest in any of the properties.] Discharge of Incumbrances on Sale 57. Provision by Court for incumbrance and sale freed therefrom.__ (a)Where immoveable property subject to any incumbrance, whether immediately payable or not, is sold by the Court or in execution of a decree, or out of Court, the Court may, if it thinks fit, on the application of any party to the sale, dire ct or allow payment into Court, — (1) in case of an annual or monthly sum charged on the property, or of a capital sum charged on a determinable interest in the pr operty__ of such amount as, when invested in securities of the 2[Federal Government], the Court considers will be sufficient, by means of the interest thereof, to keep down or otherwise provide for that charge, and 1Rep. and subs. by Act No. XX of 1929 , ss. 17-18. 2Subs. by the Federal Adaptation of Laws Order, 1975 (President’s Order No. 4 of 1975) , Art. 2 and Table.

But in either case there shall also be paid into Court such additional amount as the Court considers will be sufficient to meet the contingency of further costs, expenses and interest, and any other contingency, except depreciation of investments, not exceeding one­tenth part of the original amount to be paid in, unless the Court for special reasons (which it shall record) thinks fit to require a larger additional amount. (b) Thereupon the Court may, if it thinks fit, and after notice to the incumbrancer, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, thinks fit to dispense with such notice, decla re the property to be freed from the incumbrance, and make any order for conveyance, or vesting order, proper for giving effect to the sale, and give directions for the retention and investment of the money in Court. (c) After notice served on the persons interested in or entitled to the money or fund in Court, the Court may di rect payment or transfer thereof to the persons entitled to receive or give a discharge for the same, and generally may give directions respecting the application or distribution of the capital or income thereof.

Mortgage by co nditional sale. (c) Where the mortgagor ostensibly sells the mortgaged property__ on condition that on default of payment of the mortgage­money on a certain date the sale shall become absolute, or on condition that on such payment being made the sale shall become void, or on condition that on such payment being made the buyer shall transfer the property to the seller, the transaction is called a mortgage by conditional sale and the mortgagee a mortga gee by conditional sale: l[Provided that no such transaction shall be deemed to be a mortgage, unless the condition is embodied in the document which effects or purports to effect the sale;] Usufructuary mortgage.

But the amount of such insurance shall not exceed the amount specified in this behalf in the mortgage­deed or (if no such amount is therein specified) two­ thirds of the amount that would be require d in case of total destruction to reinstate the property insured. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize the mortgagee to insure when an insurance of the property is kept up by or on behalf of the mortgagor to the amount in which the mortgage e is hereby authorized to insure. 1[73. Right to proceeds of revenue sale or compensation on acquisition .__ (1) Where the mortgaged property or any part thereof or any interest therein is sold owing to failure to pay arrears of revenue or other charges of a public nature or rent due in respect of such property, and such failure did not arise from any default of the mortgagee, the mortgagee shall be entitled to claim payment of the mortgage­money, in whole or in part, out of any surplus of the sale proceeds remaining after payment of the arrears and of all charges and deductions directed by law.

If the mortgagee fail to perform any of the duties imposed upon him by this section, he may, when accounts are ta ken in pursuance of a decree made under this Chapter, be debited with the loss, if any, occasioned by such failure. 77. Receipts in lieu of interest. — Nothing in section 76, clauses (b), (d), (g) and (h), applies to cases where there is a contract between the mortgagee and the mortgagor that the receipts from the mortgaged property shall, so long as the mortgagee is in possession of the property, be taken in lieu of interest on the principal money, or in lieu of such interest and defined portions of the pri ncipal. Priority 78. Postponement of prior mortgagee. —Where, through the fraud, misrepresentation or gross neglect of a prior mortgagee, another person has been induced to advance money on the security of the mortgaged property, the prior mortgagee shall be postponed to the subsequent mortgagee. 79. Mortgage to secure uncertain amount when maximum is expressed. — If a mortgage made to secure future advances, the performance of an engagement or the balance of a running account, expresses the maximum to be secured thereby, a subsequent mortgage of the same property shall, if made with notice of the prior mortgage, be postponed to the prior mortgage in respect of all advances or debits not exceeding the maximum though made or allowed with notice of the subsequent mortgage. Illustration A mortgages Sultanpur to his bankers, B & Co., to secure the balance of his account with them to the extent of Rs. 10,000. A then mortgages Sultanpur to C, to secure Rs. 10,000, C having notice of the mortgage to B & Co., and C gives notice to B & Co. of the second mortgage. At the date of the second mortgage, the balance due to B & Co. does not exceed Rs. 5,000. B & Co., subsequently advance to A sums making the balance of the account against him exceed the sum of Rs. 10,000. B & Co. are entitled, to the extent of Rs. 10,000, to priority over C. 80. 1[* * * * * * *] Marshalling and Contribution 1[81. Marshalling securities. — If the owner of two or more properties mortgages them to one person and then mortgages one or more of the properties to another person, the subsequent mortgagee is, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, entitled to have the prior mortgage­debt sat isfied out of the property or properties not mortgaged to him, so far as the same will extend, but not so as to prejudice the rights of the prior mortgagee or of any other person who has for consideration acquired an interest in any of the properties.] 82. Contribution to mortgage­debt. — 1[Where property subject to a mortgage belongs to two or more persons having distinct and separate rights of ownership therein, the different shares in or parts of such property owned by such persons are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, liable 1Rep. and subs. by Act No. XX of 1929 , ss. 41 -43.

Nothing in this section ap plies to a property liable under section 81 to the claim of the 1[subsequent] mortgagee. Deposit in Court 83. Power to deposit in Court money due on mortgage. —At any time after the principal money 1[payable in respect of any mortgage has become due] and before a suit for redemption of the mortgaged property is barred, the mortgagor, or any other person entitled to institute such suit, may deposit, in any Court in which he might have instituted such suit, to the account of the mortgagee, the amount rem aining due on the mortgage. Right to money deposited by mortgagor. The Court shall thereupon cause written notice of the deposit to be served on the mortgagee, and the mortgagee may, on presenting a petition (verified in manner prescribed by law for the ve rification of plaints) stating the amount then due on the mortgage, and his willingness to accept the money so deposited in full discharge of such amount, and on depositing in the same Court the mortgage­deed 1[and all documents in his possession or power relating to the mortgaged property], apply for and receive the money, and the mortgage­deed 1[and all such other documents] so deposited shall be delivered to the mortgagor or such other person as aforesaid. 1[Where the mortgagee is in possession of the mo rtgaged property, the Court shall, before paying to him the amount so deposited, direct him to deliver possession thereof to the mortgagor and at the cost of the mortgagor either to re­transfer the mortgaged property to the mortgagor or to such third perso n as the mortgagor may direct or to execute and (where the mortgage has been effected by a registered instrument) have registered an acknowledgement in writing that any right in derogation of the mortgagor’s interest transferred to the mortgagee has been e xtinguished.] 84. Cessation of interest. —When mortgagor or such other person as aforesaid has tendered or deposited in Court under section 83 the amount remaining due on the mortgage, interest on the principal money shall cease from the date of the tender or 1[in the case of a deposit, where no previous tender of such amount has been made] as soon as the mortgagor or such other person as aforesaid has done all that has to be done by him to enable the mortgagee to take such amount out of Court, 1[and the not ice required by section 83 has been served on the mortgagee: Provided that, where the mortgagor has deposited such amount without having made a previous tender thereof and has subsequently withdrawn the same or any part thereof, interest on the principal money shall be payable from the date of such withdrawal]. 1Subs. and ins. by Act No. XX of 1929, ss. 43 -45.

Subrogation. —Any of the persons referred to in section 91 (other than the mortgagor) and any co­mortgagor shall, on redeeming property subject to the mortgage, have, so far as regards redemp tion, foreclosure or sale of such property, the same rights as the mortgagee whose mortgage he redeems may have against the mortgagor or any other mortgagee. The right conferred by this section is called the right of subrogation, and a person acquiring the same is said to be subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee whose mortgage he redeems. A person who has advanced to a mortgagor money with which the mortgage has been redeemed shall be subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee whose mortgage has been red eemed, if the mortgagor has by a registered instrument agreed that such persons shall be so subrogated. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to confer a right of subrogation on any person unless the mortgage in respect of which the right is claimed has been redeemed in full. 93. Prohibition of tacking. —No mortgagee paying off a prior mortgage, whether with or without notice of an intermediate mortgage, shall thereby acquire any priority in respect of his original security; and, except in the case provided for by section 79, no mortgagee making a subseque nt advance to the mortgagor, whether with or without notice of an intermediate mortgage, shall thereby acquire any priority in respect of his security for such subsequent advance. 1Ins. and subs. by Act No. XX of 1929 , ss. 45 -47. 2For the repealed provisions, as re­enacted, see the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act No. V of 1908), Sch.

Right of redeeming co­mortgagor to expenses. —Where one of several mortgagors redeems the mortgaged property, he shall, in enforcing his right of subrogation under section 92 against his co­ mortgagors, be entitled to add to the mortgage­money recoverable from them such proportion of the expenses prop erly incurred in such redemption as is attributable to their share in the property. 96.

When gift may be suspended or revoked. —The donor and donee may agree that on the happening of any specified event which does not depend on the will of the donor a gift shall be suspended or revoked; but a gift which the parties agree shall be revocable wholly or in part, at the mere will of the donor, is voi d wholly or in part, as the case may be. A gift may also be revoked in any of the cases (save want or failure of consideration) in which, if it were a contract, it might be rescinded. Save as aforesaid a gift cannot be revoked. Nothing contained in this se ction shall be deemed to affect the rights of transferees for consideration without notice.

Onerous gift. —Where a gift is in the form of a single transfer to the same person of several things of which one is, and the others are not, burden by an obligation, the donee can take nothing by the gift unless he accepts it fully. Where a gift is in the form of two or more separate and independent transfers to the same person of several things, the donee is at liberty to accept one of them and refuse the others, although the former may be beneficial and the latter onerous. Onerous gift to disqualified person. A donee not co mpetent to contract and accepting property burdened by any obligation is not bound by his acceptance. But if, after becoming competent to contract and being aware of the obligation, he retains the property given, he becomes so bound. Illustrations (a) A ha s shares in, X, a prosperous joint stock company, and also shares in Y, a joint stock company, in difficulties. Heavy calls are expected in respect of the shares in Y. A gives B all his shares in joint stock companies. B refuses to accept the shares in Y. He cannot take the shares in X. (b) A having a lease for a term of years of a house at a rent which he and his representatives are bound to pay during the term, and which is more than the house can be l et for, gives to B the lease, and also, as a separate and independent transaction, a sum of money. B refuses to accept the lease. He does not by this refusal forfeit the money. Page 54 of 56 128. Universal donee. —Subject to the provisions of section 127, where a gift consists of the donor’s whole property, the donee is personally liable for all the debts due by l[and liabilities of] the donor at the time of the gift to the extent of the property comprised therein. 129. Saving of donations mortis ca sua and Muslim law. —Nothing in this Chapter relates to gifts of moveable property made in contemplation of death, or shall be deemed to affect any rule of 2[Muslim] law 1[* * * ]. 3[CHAPTER VIII OF TRANSFERS OF ACTIONABLE CLAIMS 130. Transfer of actionable claim .—(1) The transfer of an actionable claim 1[whether with or without consideration] shall be effected only by the execution of an instrument in writing signed by the transferor or his duly authorized agent, 1[* * * ] shall be complete and effectual upon the execution of such instrument, and thereupon all the rights and remedies of the transferor, whether by way of damages or otherwise, shall vest in the transferee, whether such notice of the transfer as is hereinafter provided be given or not: Provided that every dealing with the debt or other actionable claim by the debtor or other person from or against whom the transferor would, but for such instrument of transfer as aforesaid, have been entitled to recover or enforce such debt or other actionable claim, shall (save where the debtor or other person is a party to the transfer or has received express notice thereof as hereinafter provided) be valid as against such transfer.

        "text": "Registration of Documents Report No. 81 REGISTRATION OF DOCUMENTS The Registration Act 1908 is an important stat ute prescribing the kind/type of documents, required to be registered and the procedur e for doing so. Under section 17 of the Act an instrument which purports or operates to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any right, title or interest to or in immovable property of the value of one hund red rupees and upward is compul sorily register-able. No document required to be registered under th is Act shall operate, create and declare any right unless it has been so registered. The registration of documents/deeds is an important legal oblig ation. The law protects the rights of the transferor and the assignee therefor e, the deed should be free from legal defects to avoid complic ations and needless litigation, arising out of defective drafting. An example of avoidable litigation in the court of law due to defective drafting may be quoted. Two persons jointly purchased a commercial property in equal shares. In the conveyance deed it was mentioned that one half-portion falling towards north will be owne d by A and the remaining half falling towards south will be owned by B. In the said conveyance deed, the boundaries were described as a road to the west, the house of Mr. X to the east, hotel to the south and the house of Mr. Y to the north, whereas the actual description should have been south west, north west, south east and north east. After sometime a dispute erupted between the parties which lead them to file suit for partition of the property. The mi sdescription of boundaries caused the dragging of the part ies into futile litigation, which ultimately ended in a compromise. The litigation however last ed for 15 years. During this period, expenses were incurred in litigatio n and parties’ and court’s time was unnecessarily wasted. It happened only because of defective drafting of the sale deed. Undoubtedly, deed writing is an important art and responsible job, but unfortunately, conveyance writing has never been given its due status as professional job in Paki stan. The Petition-writer s who are engaged in this profession, have no legal background or traini ng. It is only rarely when a lawyer is consulted for drafting a conveyance. In the large commercial cities, with the growth of general education and comple xity of transactions, sometimes conveyances are drafted by qualified perso ns i.e. lawyers but the system is not fully established. In many other citi es, mostly unskilled persons are engaged in this highly technical profession. In order to regulate this profession and attr act real capable persons in the field in the year 1942, the Registration Act 1908 wa s amended by inserti ng Part XIII A & B vide Bengal Touts Act 1942, adding Ss 80-A to 80-G and S.80-G relating to Deed-writers is as under:- (Not part of present Registration Act) (1) The Inspector General shall have powers, from time to time, to make rules consistent with this Act- (a) prescribing the manner in wh ich and the terms subject to which persons who write documents, outside the precincts of registration office, or who frequent the precincts of registration offices, for the purpose of writing document s, may be granted licenses; (b) prescribing the fees (if any) to be paid for such licenses; and (c) declaring the conditions under which persons who write documents outside the precincts of registration offices without licenses shall be deemed to be touts for the purposes of this Act. The rules so made are required to be approv ed by the provincial government and there after published in the official gazette. In England, Licensed Conveyancers ar e appointed under the Administration of Justice Act 1985 and a Council is esta blished to ensure the standards of competence and profe ssional conduct amongst persons licensed. The Council is also responsible for maki ng rules relating to the education and training of those seeking to practice as licensed conveyancers. It is for the Council to satisfy itself that the applicant has complied with t he prescribed rules and is fit and proper person to practice as a licensed conveyancer. In the province of Punjab, the Petiti on-writers are performi ng the job of Deed- writers who are appo inted by the High Co urt under Chapter 17 Part-B of High Court Rules, which are: 1. No person shall practice as a Peti tion-writer in the Punjab unless he has been duly licensed under these rules:- (1) that any person licensed under any rule hitherto in force shall be deemed to have been licensed under these rules; (2) that these rules shall not ap ply to any Advocate, Pleader or Mukhtar, in respect of a petition, written for presentation to a Court in which he is qualified to practi ce, whether such petition be written by himself or his clerk on his behalf: Provided that in the latter ca se it be signed by the employer. 2. Writing of petition.- No petition s hall be received by a Court or an officer of a court unless it is wr itten by the party or his recognized agent, or by a legal practitioner, or by a Petition- writer, except in the case of an application filed by an accused person in custody, provided the name and status of the person writing the document appea rs on it. A legal practitioner’s clerk may write such petition on behalf of his master, provided that it is signed by the latter. 3. License.- No person shall be licens ed as a Petition-writer while he is in the service of Central or Provincial Government or of a Legal Practitioner. According to Rule 2 of Part C of Chapter 17, a Petition-writer is appointed who is a Pakistani subject, above the age of twen ty years, has passed the vernacular Final Middle School Examination… In the Province of Sindh, the Petiti on-writers are appointed under Chapter III of Criminal Circular, and as per rule 26, the Chief Judge in consultation with the presiding Magistrate is requ ired to appoint Petition-wri ters. A Petition-writer is appointed for one year on fulfillment of the following requirements:- No person shall be licensed unless:- (i) He produces a certificate from the Magistrate to whose Court he seeks to be licensed certifying— (a) that he is competent to do t he work of writing complaints, applications, etc.; and (b) that he is a pers on of good character. (ii) He also produce a certificate from the Honorary Secretary of the Bar Association of the District in which the Court to which he seeks to be licensed is situated, certif ying that in the opinion of the Committee of the Association he has not within the past twelve months directly or indirectly received or demanded any commission for introducing business and that he does not associate with touts; (iii) He submits his petition for a license through the District Magistrate and Sessions Judge in whose jurisd iction the Court to which he seeks to be licensed is situated. In the absence of any law regulating the qualifications of c onveyance-writers, mostly unqualified persons have occupied this field. The ordinary Petition-writers who are not supposed to write Deeds are generally engaged in writing of conveyances of technical nature which r equire special proficiency as, there are so many other technical requirements in cidental to registration process i.e. assessment of proper registration fee, to handle cases where Registrar refuses to admit document, payment of defici ent and refund of access stamp duty, rectification of objections raised by the R egistrar, etc. These functions obviously can not adequately be performed by an un qualified person, nor the job can be entrusted to unskilled persons. As the preparation of deeds/i nstruments writing requires specialized knowledge and skill , hence the profession needs to be regulated through amendment in law. The matter was placed before the Commission in its meeting held on 25-26 September 1999 to consider t he following two alternates: (1) Section 69 of the Registration Act which prescribe the power of Inspector General to superintend registration offi ces and make rules in this regard. It was suggested that he ma y also be given the power to frame rules prescribing the qualifications for deed writers and the manner in which deeds shall be written and filed by pers ons other than an advocate. Such rules should also prescribe the f ees (if any) to be paid for obtaining licenses for deed writing, and penalty for violation of the said rules; or (2) The respective Bar Councils may be assigned responsibilities to regulate and make arrangement for registra tion of advocates/group of advocates/firms who intend to engage t hemselves for legal documentation on the pattern of the Administration of Justice Act 1985 enforced in England or any other appropriate method proposed by the Bars/Bar Councils. Here it is worth mentioning that in Karachi, some advocates have formed law firms/companies and est ablished their offices exclusively meant for legal documentati on and conveyance writing. The Commission considered the above-ment ioned alternatives and approved the view that appropriate qualifications may be prescribed for conveyancers, so as to put and end to the nuisance of defective drafting of legal instruments/deeds, which result in mental agony, financial lo ss and litigation. The Commission also noted the incidents of fraud and misrepresentation in deeds and observed that appropriate measures, including the formula tion of new rules, may be adopted so that qualified persons do conveyancing and drafting of instruments/deeds to enhance the sanctity of title documents and put an end to the incidents of fraud and misrepresentation. The Commission also observed that the fee structure for registration of deed/document might be ra tionalized to encourage people to go for registration, which can prove to be a source of revenue generation of the State. Accordingly, the Commission aske d the Secretary, PLC to examine the issue and suggest an appropr iate option for consideration of the Commission after consultation with the Deed Registra tion Offices and members of the bar. Earlier, the Secretariat sent the draft proposal on 16 August 1999 to the Vice Chairman of Pakistan Bar Council and Pr ovincial Bar Councils, the Provincial Law Departments, Joint Registrars at Lahor e, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta and Presidents of some District Bar Associ ations, with a view to obtain their views/comments on the issue. The La w Department of the Government of NWFP and the District Bar Associat ion, Abbottabad have responded and supported the option that deed-wr iting be entrusted to lawy ers. They stated that it will put an end to the problems of defecti ve drafting and will relieve the general public of many hardships and unnecessary litigation. Subsequently, reminders were sent on 22 January 2000, 28 July 2000 and 9 April 2001 to the c oncerned agencies/dependants for response. Very few responded. The Punjab Bar Council e ndorsed the second option of the Secretariat that the j ob be entrusted to the en rolled advocates/firms of advocates. The President, Lahore High Court Bar Association also supported the same view and suggested that appropriate amendments be made in the Registration Act to this effect. Meanw hile, the Ministry of Law, Justice and Human Rights forwarded a copy of the resolution passed by General House of the Lahore High Court Bar Asso ciation, Lahore for consideration. The resolution states – “This house unanimously recommend to the Commission of the Law & Justice to make changes in the law regarding conveyancing and documentation of Gift, Hiba, Tam lik, Will, Bequest, Sale-Deed, Agreement to sell, etc in the regist ry branch of each District, Division, Sub-Division of every city to be handed over to the lawyers not less then 4 years of standing of the Bar. The documentation of all these tr ansaction shall be made, drawn, drafted and verified by the lawyer s of the above mentioned standing and upon completion of the transact ion a reasonable amount be fixed for completion, presentation, atte station and registration of such documents. It is further recommended by this house that the assignment of the completion of these documents be m ade as solicitors-in-charge of registry branch. The aforesaid amendments in the law will facilitate the documentation of transaction of transfer of sale , etc by legal expertise and shall eliminate the aspects of fraud, fo rgery and misrepresentation of the deed-writers.” (Justice ® Mrs. Fakhar-un-Nisa Khokhar) President, Lahore High Court Bar Association, Lahore. The following notification is proposed by the Lahore High Court Bar Association:- Proposed Notification “Whereas it is expedient to further r egulate the practice of conveyancing and deed writing in the province of Punj ab to safeguard the public interest. Now, therefore, the Gover nor of the Punjab in exercise of powers under all enabling provisions to do, hereby directs as under:- i) Deeds of any kinds which are requi red under the law to be written on a stamp paper of value exceeding Rs. 100/- shall be drafted by an advocate whose name exists in t he record of the Punjab Bar Council for which he shall be entitled to charge a fee according to a scale prescribed by the Government. ii) A certificate to the above effe ct shall be appended wit h the Deed under the stamp and signatures of the Ad vocate concerned, failing which, no court or authority shall admit such document in any manner what so ever. iii) The Punjab Bar Council shall issue a certificate in this connection to the advocate for this purpose. iv) In case of any defective and improperly drafted deed the court or authority may return the said- document to the executants.” The Secretariat of the Commission re-e xamined the above referred alternative i.e. entrusting the job of deed-writing exclusive to the enrolled advocates or prescribing appropriate qualifications/ex perience for the Petition-writers/Deed- writers already engaged in this professi on. It may be stat ed that a good numbers of people are engaged in this professi on throughout Pakistan since long and putting a sudden ban on them is inappropri ate. Besides they have acquired a certain amount of experience in the job. Further, they charge modest fee for their services. Their services may be utilized effectively and in appropriate way be amending the existing law prescribi ng minimum educational qualifications, experience, training and procedure for t heir enrollment and condu ct of business. It is therefore, suggested, that the first option of amending Section 69 of the Registration Act 1908, empowering the Inspector General, Registration to prescribe of minimum educational qualific ations and the manners of enrollment of deed-writers may be considered to regulate and supervise the profession of deed-writing. The task can be assigned to the authority to eliminate unauthorized persons from entering this prof ession. Preferably, some measures may be suggested on the pattern of the Bengal Touts Act 1942 and the Inspector General may be given powers to pr escribe terms and conditions, minimum qualifications for Deed-writ ers, beside the powers to superintend registration offices as he is a already empowered un der section 69 of the registration Act, and to make rules accordingly. It is, therefore, proposed that:- 1. Section 69 of the Act may be am ended and a new clause (aa) may be added as under:- (aa) regulating and supervising the profession of conveyance writing; 2. In the Act, a new sect ion 81-A may be added as under:- 81-A. Engagement as Conveyancer without license.- Whoever, engages himself as Conveyancer wit hout enrolment or license shall be liable to imprisonment of one month or fine of rupees five thousand or both; 3. The following Rules may be fr amed under section 69 of the Act: (i) Procedure for grant of license and enrolment.- (1) Where, in the opinion of Inspector General of Regi stration, a person who fulfils the following conditions, namely:- (a) possesses the higher secondar y school certificate from any recognized Board of Intermedi ate and Secondary Education; and (b) qualifies the prescribed cour se of deed writing conducted under these rules. May granted him a license and enroll him as conveyancer, notifying his name in the official gazette. (2) After every three years the convey ancer who was enro lled shall attend a prescribed refresher course followed by an evaluation test. (ii) Cancellation of License.- if a conveyancer absents himself from or fails to qualify the refresher course or his conduct with public is not satisfactory, the Inspector General of Registration shall cancel his license and strike off his name from roll, a fter giving him an opportunity of show cause. (iii) Enrolment Fee.- A conveyancer shall pay rupees five hundred as registration and rupee one hundred as annual renewal fee. (iv) Penalty.- Any person who is enga ged as conveyancer without enrolment or licence shall be liable to imprisonment of one month or fine of rupees five thousand on both. A Bill Further to amend the Registration Act, 1908 Whereas it is necessary to amend t he Registration Act 1908 for the purposes hereinafter mentioned; It is hereby enacted as follows. 1. Short title and extent.- (1) This Act may be called the Registration (Amendment) Act, 2002. (2) it shall come into force at once. 2. Amendment of Section 69, Act XVI of 1908. - In the Registration Act 1908 (XVI of 1908), hereinafter referred to as the said Act, in section 69, in sub-section (1), the existing clause (a ) shall be renumbered as clause (aa) and before clause (aa) renumbered as af oresaid, the following new clause shall be inserted, namely:- “(a) regulating and supervising the profession of conv eyance writing”. 3. Insertion of section 81- A, Act XV of 1908.- In the said Act, after section 81, the following new section shall be inserted, namely:- “81-A. Engagement as conveyancer without enrolment.- Whoever, engages himself as conveyancer without enrolment or license shall be liable to imprisonment of one month or fine of rupees five thousand or both”. Notification S.R.O_______/2002 dated _________ in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 69 of the Registration Act, 1908, the Inspec tor General of Registration, with the approval of the Provincial Govern ment, is pleased to make the following Rules, namely:- 1.

(2) It shall apply to the whol e of the province of ______ (3) They shall come into force at once. 2. Definition.- In these rules unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context (i) ‘Act’ means the Registration Act, 1908; (ii) ‘Conveyancer’ means a person duly authorized under these rules to write conveyance deeds for the pur pose of registration under the Act but does not include an advocate, firm of advocates or a legal practitioner enrolled under the L egal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act 1973; (iii) ‘Inspector General of Regist ration’ means a person appointed under section 3 of the Act. 3.

Commission’s deliber ation on 10.06.2006 The working paper was considered by the Commission in its meeting held on 10.6.2006and the following ar e the deliberations:- The Commission considered the proposal to amend the provisions of the Registration Act 1908 and the rules m ade thereunder to regulate and supervise job of conveyance writing. The Commi ssion was informed that presently the petition writers licenced by the High Courts, perform th e job of deeds/conveyance writing that are not qualified for it. The defective deeds create a lot of hardships to the parties and give rise to litigat ion in the courts. The Commission also considered recommendation received from the Lahore High Court Bar Association that the lawyers may be assigned the job of conveyance/deed writing. The Chairman remarked that lawyers have studied the subject of conveyancing in the law cour se therefore, they will be better qualified for writing of deeds/ conveyance. The Secretary Mi nistry of Law and Justice Division expressed that lawyers ar e not competent for the dee d writing unless they have some experience in the field. The Chie f Justice High Court of Sindh observed that lawyers may receive fixed fee of Rs . 200/- for writing of conveyance /deeds. After these deliberations the Commissi on approved the proposal to amend the Registration Ac 1908 and the rules ma de thereunder to regulate the enrolment and licencing of deed / conveyance writing by the Inspector General of Registration. The Commission added that la wyers, being eligible, must also continue to draft conveyances and deeds",

Recovery of specific immoveable property. A person entitled to the possession of specific immoveable property may recover it in the manner prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure2. 39. Suit by person dispossessed of immoveable property. If any person is dispossessed without his consent of immovea ble property otherwise than in due course of law, he or any person claiming through him may, by suit 4* * * recover possession thereof, notwithstanding any other title that may be set up in such suit. 1See now the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908). 2See now the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act 5 of 1908). 3But see as to tenancies in the Punjab, the Punjab Tenancy Act, 1887 (16 of 1887), s. 51. 4The words “instituted within six months from the date of the dispossession” rep. by the Repealing and Amending Act, 1891 (12 of 1891) (w.e.f . 21st March, 1891). Page 8 of 35 Nothing in this section shall bar any person from suing to establish his title to such property and to recover possession thereof. No suit under this section shall be brought against 1[the 2[Federal Government] or any Provincial Government]. No appeal shall lie from any order or decree passed in any suit instituted under this section, nor shall any review of any such order or decree be allowed. (b) Possession of Moveble Property 10. Recovery of specific moveable property. A person entitled to the possession of specific moveable property may recover the same in the manner prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure3. Explanation 1.__ A trustee may sue under this section for the possession of property to the beneficial interest in which the person for whom he is trustee is entitled. Explanation 2.__ A special or temporary right to the present possession of property is sufficient to support a suit under this section. Illustrations (a) A bequeaths land to B for his life, with remainder to C. A dies. B enters on the land, but C, without B’s consent, obtains possession of the title deeds. B may recover them from C. (b) A pledges certain Jewels to B to secure a loan. B disposes of them before he is entitled to do so. A, without having paid or tendered the amount of the loan, sues B for possession of the jewels. The suit should be dismissed, as A is not entitled to their possession, whatever right he may have to secure their safe custody. (c) A receives a letter addressed to him by B. B gets back the letter without A’s consent. A has such a property therein as entitles him to recover it from B. (d) A deposit books and papers for safe custody with B. B loses them and C finds them, but refuses to deliver them to B when demanded. B may recover them from C, subject to C’s right, if any, under section 168 of the Contract Act, 1872 (IX of 1872). (e) A, a warehouse­keeper, is charged with the delivery of certain goods to Z, which B takes out of A’s possession. A may sue B for the goods. 1The original words “the Government” were first subs. by A. O., 1937 (w.e.f. 1st April, 1937) and then amended by A. O., 1949 (w.e.f. 28th March, 1949) to read as above. 2Subs. by F. A. O., 1975, Art. 2, for “Central Government” (w.e.f . 28th July, 1975). 3See now the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act 5 of 1908). Page 9 of 35 11. Liability of person in possession, not as owner, to deliver to person entitled to immediate possession. Any person having the possession or control of a particular article of moveable property, of which he is not the owner, may be co mpelled specifically to deliver it to the person entitled to its immediate possession, in any of the following cases :__ (a) when the thing claimed is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee of the claimant; (b) when compensation in money would not afford the claimant adequate relief for the loss of the thing claimed; (c) when it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual damage caused by its loss; (d) when the possession of the thing claimed has been wrongfully transferred from the claimant. Illustrations of clause (a)— A, proceeding to Europe, leaves his furniture in charge of B as his agent during his absence. B, without A’s authority, pledges the furniture to C, and C, knowing that B had no right to pledge the furniture, advertises it for sale. C may be compelled to deliver the furniture to A, for he holds it as A’s trustee. of clause (b)— Z has got possession of an idol belonging to A’s family, and of which A is the proper custodian. Z may be compelled to deliver the idol to A. of clause (c) A is entitled to a picture by a dead painter and a pair of rare China vases. B has possession of them. The articles are of too special a character to bear an ascertainable market­value. B may be compelled to deliver them to A. CHAPTER II OF THE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS (a) Contracts which may be specifically enforced 12. Cases in which specific performance enforceable. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, the specific performance of any contract may in the discretion of the Court be enforced___ (a) when the act agreed to be done is in the performance, wholly or partly, of a trust; Page 10 of 35 (b) when 1[their] exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused by non­ performance of the act agreed to be done; (c) when the act agreed to be done is such that pecuniary compensation for its non­performance would not afford adequate relief; or (d) when it is probable that pecuniary compensation cannot be got for the non­performance of the act agreed to be done. Explanation.___ Unless and until the contrary is proved, the Court shall presume that the breach of a contract to transfer immoveable property cannot be adequately relieved by compensation in money, and that the breach of a contract to transfer moveable property can be thus relieved. Illustrations 2* * * * * * * of clause (b)— A agrees to buy, and B agrees to sell, a picture by a dead painter and two rare China vases. A may compel B specifically to perform this contract, for there is no standard for ascertaining the actual damage which would be caused by its non­performance. of clause (c)— A contracts with B to sell him a house for Rs. 1,000. B is entitled to a decree directing A to convey the house to him, he paying the purchase­money. In consideration of being released from certain obligations imposed on it by its act of Incorporation, a railway­company contract with Z to make an archway through their railway to connect lands of Z served by the railway, to construct a road between certain specified points, to pay a certain annual sum towards the maintenance of this road, and also to construct a siding and a wharf as specified in the contract. Z is entitled to have this contract specifically enforced, for his interest in its performance cannot be adequately compensated for by money: and the Court may appoint a proper person to superintend the construction of the archway, road, siding and wharf. A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, a certain number of railway shares of a particular description. A refuses to complete the sale. B may compel A specifically to perform this agreement, for the shares are limited in number and not always to be had in the market, and their possession carries with it the status of a shareholder, which cannot otherwise be procured. A contracts with B to paint a picture for B, who agrees to pay therefor Rs. 1,000. The picture is painted. B is entitled to have it delivered to him on payment or tender of the Rs. 1,000. 1See. should read “there”. 2The first Illustration omitted by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration) Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s.3 and 2nd Sch. Page 11 of 35 of clause (d) — A transfers without endorsement, but for valuable consideration, a promissory note to B. A becomes insolvent, and C is appointed his assignee. B may compel C to endorse the note, for C has succeeded to A’s liabilities, and a decree for pecuniary compensation for not endorsing the note would be fruitless. 13. Contract of which the subject has partially ceased to exist. Notwithstanding anything contained in section 56 of the Contract Act, a contract is not wholly impossible of performance because a portion of its subject matter, existing at its date, has ceased to exist at the time of the performance. 1* * * * * * * * 14. Specific performance of part of contract where part unperformed is small. Where a party to a contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it, but the part which must be left unperformed bears only a small proportion to the whole in value, and admits of compensation in money, the Court may, at the suit of either party, direct the specific performance of so much of the contract as can be performed, and award compensation in money for the deficiency. Illustrations (a) A contracts to sell B a piece of lane consisting of 100 bighas. It turns out that 98 bighas of the land belong to A, and the two remaining bighas to a stranger, who refuses to part with them. The two bighas are not necessary for the use or enjoyment of the 98 bighas, nor so important for such use of enjoyment that the loss of them may not be made good in money. A may be directed at the suit of B to convey to B the 98 bighas and to make compensation to him for not conveying the two remaining bighas ; or B may be directed, at the suit of A, to pay to A, on receiving the conveyance and possession of the land, the stipulated purchase­money less a sum awarded as compensation for the deficiency. (b) In a contract for the sale and purchase of a house and lands for two lakhs of rupees, it is agreed that part of the furniture should be taken at a valuation. The Court may direct specific performance of the contract notwithstanding the parties are unable to agree as to the valuation of the furniture, and may either have the furnitur e valued in the suit and include it in the decree for specific performance, or may confine its decree to the house. 15. Specific performance of part of contract where part unperformed is large. Where a party to a contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it, and the part which must be left unperformed forms a considerable portion of the whole, or does not admit of compensation in money, he is not entitled to obtain a decree for specific performance. But the Court may, at the suit of the other party direct the party in default to perform specifically so much of his part of the contract as he can perform, provided that the plaintiff relinquishes all claim to further performance, and all right to compensation either for the deficiency, or for the loss or damage sustained by him through the default of the defendant. 1Omitted by Ord. No. XXII of 1983, s.2. Page 12 of 35 Illustrations (a) A contracts to sell to B a piece of land consisting of 100 bighas. It turns out that 50 bighas of the land belong to A, and the other 50 bighas to a stranger, who refuses to part with them. A cannot obtain a decree against B for the specific performance of the contract; but if B is willing to pay the price agreed upon, and to take the 50 bighas which belong to A, waiving all right to compensation either for the deficiency or for loss sustained by him through A’s neglect or default, B is entitled to a decree directing A to convey those 50 bighas to him on payment of the purchase­money. (b) A contracts to sell to B an estate with a house and garden for a lakh of rupees. The garden is important for the enjoyment of the house. It turns out that A is unable to convey the garden. A cannot obtain a decree against B for the specific performance of the contract, but if B is willing to pay the price agreed upon, and to take the estate and house without the garden, waiving all right to compensation either for the deficiency or for loss sustained by him through A’s neglect or default, B is entitled to a decree directing A to convey the house to him on payment of the purchase­money. 16. Specific performance of independent part of contract. When a part of a contract which, taken by itself, can and ought to be specifically performed, stands on a separate and independent footing from another part of the same contract which cannot or ought not to be specifically performed, the Court may direct specific performance of the former part. 17. Bar in other cases of specific performance of part of contract. The Court shall not direct the specific performance of a part of a contract except in cases coming under one or other of the three last preceding sections. 18. Purchaser’s rights against vendor with imperfect title. Where a person contracts to sell or let certain property, having only an imperfect title thereto, the purchaser or lessee (except as otherwise provided by this Chapter) has the following rights:__ (a) if the vendor or lessor has subsequently to the sale or lease acquired any interest in the property, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to make good the contract out of such interest; (b) where the concurrence of other persons is necessary to validate the title, and they are bound to convey at the vendor’s or lessor’s request, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure such concurrence; (c) where the vendor professes to sell unincumbered property, but the property is mortgaged for an amount not exceeding the purchase­money, and the vendor has in fact only a right to redeem it, the purchaser may compel him to redeem the mortgage and to obtain a conveyance from the mortgagee; (d) where the vendor or lessor sues for specific performance of the contract, and the suit is dismissed on the ground of his imperfect title, the defendant has a right to a return of his deposit (if any) with interest thereon, to his costs of the suit, and to a lien for such deposit, interest and costs on the interest of the vendor or lessor in the property agreed to be sold or let. Page 13 of 35 19. Power to award compensation in certain cases. Any person suing for the specific performance of a contract may also ask for compensation for its breach, either in addition to, or in substitution for, such performance. If in any such suit the Court decides that specific performance ought not to be granted, but that there is a contract between the parties which has been broken by the defendant and that the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for that breach, it shall award him compensation accordingly. If in any such suit the Court decides that specific performance ought to be granted, but that it is not sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case, and that some compensation for breach of the contract should also be made to the plaintiff, it shall award him such compensation accordingly. Compensation awarded under this section may be assessed in such manner as the Court may direct. Explanation.__ The circumstance that the contract has become incapable of specific performance does not preclude the Court from exercising the jurisdiction conferred by this section. Illustrations of the second paragraph___ A contracts to sell a hundred maunds of rice to B. B brings a suit to compel A to perform the contract or to pay compensation. The Court is of opinion that A has made a valid contract and has broken it, without excuse, to the injury of B, but that specific performance is not the proper remedy. It shall award to B such compensation as it deems just. of the third paragraph___ A contracts with B to sell him a house for Rs. 1,000, the price to be paid and the possession given on the 1st January 1877. A fails to perform his part of the contract, and B brings his suit for specific performance and compensation, which is decided in his favour on the 1st January, 1878. The decree may, besides ordering specific performance, award to B compensation for any loss which he has sustained by A’s refusal. of the Explanation___ A, a purchaser, sues B, his vendor, for specific performance of a contract for the sale of a patent. Before the hearing of the suit the patent expires. The Court may award A compensation for the non­ performance of the contract, and may, if necessary, amend the plaint for that purpose. A sues for the specific performance of a resolution passed by the Directors of a public company, under which he was entitled to have a certain number of shares allotted to him, and for compensation for the non­performance of the resolution. All the shares had been allotted before the institution of the suit. The Court may, under this section, award A compensation for the non­performance. 20. Liquidation of damages not a bar to specific performance. A contract, otherwise proper to be specifically enforced, may be thus enforced, though a sum be named in it as the amount to be paid in case of its breach, and the party in default is willing to pay the same. Page 14 of 35 Illustration A contracts to grant B an under­lease of property held by A under C, and that he will apply to C for a license necessary to the validity of the under­lease, and that, if the license is not procured, A will pay B Rs. 10,000. A refuses to apply for the license and offers to pay B the Rs. 10,000. B is nevertheless entitled to have the contract specifically enforced if C consents to give the license. (b) Contracts which cannot be specifically enforced 21. Contracts not specifically enforceable. The following contracts cannot be specifically enforced:___ (a) a contract for the non­performance of which compensation in money is an adequate relief; (b) a contract which runs into such minute or numerous details, or which is so dependent on the personal qualifications or volition of the parties, or otherwise from its nature is such, that the Court cannot enforce specific performance of its material terms; (c) a contract the terms of which the Court cannot find with reasonable certainty; (d) a contract which is in its nature revocable; (e) a contract made by trustees either in excess of their powers or in breach of their trust; (f) a contract made by or on behalf of a corporation or public company created for special purposes, or by the promoters of such company, which is in excess of its powers; (g) a contract the performance of which involves the performance of a continuous duty extending over a longer period than three years from its date; (h) a contract of which a material part of the subject­matter, supposed by both parties to exist, has, before it has been made, ceased to exist. And, save as provided by the 1[Arbitration Act, 1940 (X of 1940 )], no contract to refer 2[present or future differences] to arbitration shall be specifically enforced; 3but if any person who has made such a contract 4[other than an arbitration agreement to which the provisions of the said Act apply] and has refused to perform it sues in respect of any subject which he has contracted to refer, the existence of such contract shall bar the suit. 1Subs. by the Arbitration Act,1940 (10 of 1940), s. 49 and IV Sch., (w.e.f. 1st July, 1940) for “Code of Civil Procedure, [and the Indian Arbitration Act, 1899,]”. The words in brackets had been ins. by the Indian Arbitration Act, 1899 (9 of 1899), s. 21 (w.e.f. 1st July, 1899). 2Subs. by A ct, 9 of 1899, s. 21 for “a controversy”. 3The last thirty­seven words of s. 21, do not apply to any submission or arbitration to which the provisions of the Indian Arb itration Act, 1899 (9 of 1899), for the time being apply ( see s. 3 of that Act), or to a ny agreement to refer to arbitration or to any award to which Sch.

A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, 40 chests of indigo at Rs. 1,000 per chest: In consideration of certain property having been transferred by A to B, B contracts to open a credit in A’s favour to the extent of Rs. 10,000, and to honour A’s drafts to that amount; The above contracts cannot be specifically enforced, for in the first and second both A and B, and in the third A, would be reimbursed by compensation in money. to (b)___ A contracts to render personal service to B: A contracts to employ B on personal service: A, an author, contracts with B, a publisher, to complete a litrary work: B cannot enforce specific performance of these contracts. A contracts to buy B’s business at the amount of a valuation to be made by two valuers, one to be named by A and the other by B. A and B each name a valuer, but before the valuation is made, A instructs his valuer not to proceed: By a charter­party entered into in 2[Chittagong] between A, the owner of a ship, and B, the charterer, it is agreed that the ship shall proceed to 3[Karachi] and there load a cargo of rice, and thence proceed to London, freight to be paid, one­third on arrival at 3[Karachi], and two­thirds on delivery of the cargo in London : A lets land to B and B contracts to cultivate it in a particular manner for three years next after the date of the lease: A and B contract that, in consideration of annual advances to be made by A, B will for three years next after the date of the contract grow particular crops on the land in his possession and deliver them to A when cut and ready for delivery: A contracts with B that, in consideration of Rs.1,000 to be paid to him by B, he will paint a picture for B : A contracts with B to execute certain works which the Court cannot superintend: A contracts to supply B with all the goods of a certain class which B may require: A contracts with B to take from B a lease of a certain house for a specified term, at a specified rent, \"if the drawing­room is handsomely decorated,\" even if it is held to have so much certainty that compensation can be recovered for its breach: 1Subs. by F.A.O., 1975, Art. 2, for “Central Government” ( w.e.f . 28th July, 1975) which had be en subs. by A.

Page 16 of 35 A contracts to marry B : The above contracts cannot be specifically enforced. To (c)___ A, the owner of a refreshment­room, contracts, with B to give him accommodation there for the sale of his goods and to furnish him with the necessary appliances. A refuses, to perform his contract. The case is one for compensation and not for specific performance, the amount and the nature of the accommodation and appliances being undefined. To (d)___ A and B contract to become partners in a certain business, the contract not specifying the duration of the proposed partnership. This contract cannot be specifically performed, for, if it were so performed, either A or B might at once dissolve the partnership. to (e)___ A is a trustee of land with power to lease it for seven years. He enters into a contract with B to grant a lease of the land for seven years, with a covenant to renew the lease at the expiry of the term. This contract cannot be specifically enforced. The Directors of a company have power to sell the concern with the sanction of a general meeting of the shareholders. They contract to sell it without any such sanction. This contract cannot be specifically enforced. Two trustees, A and B, empowered to sell trust­property worth a lakh of rupees, contract to sell it to C for Rs. 30,000. The contract is so disadvantageous as to be a breach of trust. C cannot enforce its specific performance. The promoters of a company for working mines contract that the company, when formed, shall purchase certain mineral property. They take no proper precautions to ascertain the value of such property__ and in fact agree to pay an extravagant price therefor. They also stipulate that the vendors shall give them a bonus out of the purchase­money. This contract cannot be specifically enforced. to (f)___ A company existing for the sole purpose of making and working a railway contract for the purchase of a piece of land for the purpose of erecting a cottonmill thereon. This contract cannot be specifically enforced. to (g)___ A contracts to let for twenty­one years to B the right to use such part of a certain railway made by A as was upon B’s land, and that B should have a right of running carriages over the whole line on certain terms, and might require A to supply the necessary engine­power, and that A should during the term keep the whole railway in good repair. Specific performance of this contract must be refused to B. Page 17 of 35 to (h)___ A contracts to pay an annuity to B for the lives of C and D. It turns out that, at the date of the contract, C, though supposed by A and B to be alive, was dead. The contract cannot be specifically performed. (c) Of the Discretion of the Court 22. Discretion as to decreeing specific performance. The jurisdiction to decree specific performance is discretionary, and the Court is not bound to grant such relief merely because it is lawful to do so; but the discretion of the Court is not arbitrary but sound and reasonable, guided by judicial principles and capable of correction by a Court of appeal. The following are cases in which the Court may properly exercise a discretion not to decree specific performance:___ I. Where the circumstances under which the contract is made are such as to give the plaintiff an unfair advantage over the defendant, though there may be no fraud or misrepresentation on the plaintiff’s part. Illustrations (a) A, a tenant for life of certain property, assigns his interest therein to B. C contracts to buy, and B contracts to sell, that interest. Before the contract is completed, A receives a mortal injury from the effects of which he dies the day after the contract is executed. If B and C were equally ignorant or equally aware of the fact, B is entitled to specific performance of the contract. If B knew the fact, and C did not, specific performance of the contract should be refused to B. (b) A contracts to sell to B the interest of C in certain stock­in­trade. It is stipulated that the sale shall stand good, even though it should turn out that C’s interest is worth nothing. In fact, the value of C’s interest depends on the result of certain partnership­accounts, on which he is heavily in debt to his partners. This indebtedness is known to A, but not to B. Specific performance of the contract should be refused to A. (c) A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, certain land. To protect the land from floods, it is necessary for its owner to maintain an expensive embankment. B does not know of this circumstance, and A conceals it from him. Specific performance of the contract should be refused to A. (d) A’s property is put up to auction. B requests C, A’s attorney, to bid for him. C does this inadvertently and in good faith. The persons present, seeing the vendor’s attorney bidding, think that he is a mere puffer and cease to compete. The lot is knocked down to B at a low price. Specific performance of the contract should be refused to B. II. Where the performance of the contract would involve some hardship on the defendant which he did not foresee, whereas its non­performance would involve no such hardship on the plaintiff. Page 18 of 35 Illustrations 1* * * * * * * (f) A and B, trustees, join their beneficiary, C, in a contract to sell the trust­estate to D, and personally agree to exonerate the estate from heavy encumbrances to which it is subject. The purchase­money is not nearly enough to discharge those encumbrances, though, at the date of the contract, the vendors believed it to be sufficient. Specific performance of the contract should be refused to D. (g) A, the owner of an estate, contracts to sell it to B, and stipulates that he, A, shall not be obliged to define its boundary. The estate really comprises a valuable property, not known to either to be part of it. Specific performance of the contract should be refused to B unless he waives his claim to the unknown property. (h) A contracts with B to sell him certain land, and to make a road to it from a certain railway­station. It is found afterwards that A cannot make the road without exposing himself to litigation. Specific performance of the part of the contract relating to the road should be refused to B, even though it may be held that he is entitled to specific performance of the rest with compensation for loss of the road. (i) A, a lessee of mines, contracts with B, his lessor, that at any time during the continuance of the lease B may give notice of his desire to take the machinery and plant used in and about the mines, and that he shall have the articles specified in his notice delivered to him at a valuation on the expiry of the lease. Such a contract might be most injurious to the lessee’s business, and specific performance of it should be refused to B. (j) A contracts to buy certain la nd from B. The contract is silent as to access to the land. No right of way to it can be shown to exist. Specific performance of the contract should be refused to B. (k) A contracts with B to buy from B’s manufactory and not elsewhere all the goods of a ce rtain class used by A in his trade. The Court cannot compel B to supply the goods, but if he does not supply them, A may be ruined unless he is allowed to buy them elsewhere. Specific performance of the contract should be refused to B. The following is a case in which the Court may properly exercise a discretion to decree specific performance: III. Where the plaintiff has done substantial acts or suffered losses in consequence of a contract capable of specific performance. 1Omitted by Ord. XXII of 1983, s.3.

Except as otherwise provided by this Chapter, the specific performance of a contract may be obtained by___ (a) any party thereto; (b) the representative in interest , or the principal, of any party thereto: provided that, where the learning, skill, solvency or any personal quality of such party is a material ingredient in the contract, or where the contract provides that his interest shall not be assigned, his representative in interest or his principal shall not be entitled to specific performance of the contract, unless where his part thereof has already been performed; (c) where the contract is a settlement on marriage, or a compromise of doubtful rights between members of the same family, any person beneficially entitled there under; (d) where the contract has been entered into by a tenant for life in due exercise of a power, the remainder man; (e) a reversioner in possession, where the agreement is a covenant entered into with his predecessor in title and the reversioner is entitled to the benefit of such covenant; (f) a reversioner in remainder, where the agreement is such a covenant, and the reversioner is entitled to the benefit thereof and will sustain material injury by reason of its breach; (g) when a public company has entered into a contract and subsequently becomes amalgamated with another public company, the new company which arises out of the amalgamation; (h) when the promoters of a public company have, before its incorporation, entered into a contract for the purposes of the company, and such contract is warranted by the terms of the incorporation, the company. (e) For whom Contracts cannot be specifically enforced. 24. Personal bars to the relief. Specific performance of a contract cannot be enforced in favour of a person__ (a) who could not recover compensation for its breach; Page 20 of 35 (b) who has become incapable of performing, or violates, any essential term of the contract that on his part remains to be performed; (c) who has already chosen his remedy and obtained satisfaction for the alleged breach of contract; or (d) who, previously to the contract, had notice that a settlement of the subject­matter thereof (though not founded on any valuable consideration) had been made and was then in force. Illustrations to clause (a)___ A, in the character of agent for B, enters into an agreement with C to buy C’s house. A is in reality acting, not as agent for B, but on his own account. A cannot enforce specific performance of this contract. to clause (b) A contracts to sell B a house and to become tenant thereof for a term of fourteen years from the date of the sale at a specified yearly rent. A becomes insolvent. Neither he nor his assignee can enforce specific performance of the contract. A contracts to sell B a house and garden in which there are ornamental trees, a material element in the value of the property as a residence. A, without B’s consent, fells the trees. A cannot enforce specific performance of the contract. A, holding land under a contract with B for a lease, commits waste, or treats the land in an unhusband like manner. A cannot enforce specific performance of the contract. A contracts to let, and B contracts to take, an unfinished house, B contracting to finish the house and the lease to contain covenants on the part of A to keep the house in repair. B finishes the house in a very defective manner: he cannot enforce the contract specifically, though A and B may sue each other for compensation for breach of it. to clause (c) A contracts to let, and B contracts to take, a house for a specified term at a specified rent. B refuses to perform the contract. A thereupon sues for, and obtains, compensation for the breach. A cannot obtain specific performance of the contract. 25. Contracts to sell property by one who has no title or who is a voluntary settler. A contract for the sale or letting of property, whether moveable or immoveable, cannot be specifically enforced in favour of a vendor or lessor – (a) who, knowing himself not to have any title to the property, has contracted to sell or let the same; (b) who, though he entered into the contract believing that he had a good title to the property, cannot , at the time fixed by the parties or by the Court for the completion of the sale or letting, give the purchaser or lessee a title free from Page 21 of 35 reasonable doubt; (c) who, previous to entering into the contract, has made settlement (though not founded on any valuable consideration) of the subject­matter of the contract. Illustrations (a) A, without C’s authority, contracts to sell to B an estate which A knows to belong to C. A cannot enforce specific performance of this contract, even though C is willing to confirm. (b) A bequeaths his land to trustees declaring that they may sell it with the consent in writing of B. B gives a general prospective assent in writing to any sale which the trustees may make. The trustees then enter into a contract with C to sell him the land. C refuses to carry out the contract. The trustees cannot specifically enforce this contract, as in the absence of B’s consent to the particular sale to C, the title which they can give C is, as the law stands, not free from reasonable doubt. (c) A, being in possession of certain land, contracts to sell it to Z. On inquiry it turns out that A claims the land as heir of B, who left the country several years before, and is generally believed to be dead, but of whose death there is no sufficient proof. A cannot compel Z specifically to perform the contract. (d) A, out of natural love and affection, makes a settlement of certain property on his brothers and their issue, and afterwards enters into a contract to sell the property to a stranger. A cannot enforce specific performance of this contract so as to override the settlement, and thus prejudice the interests of the persons claiming under it. (f) For whom Contracts cannot be specifically enforced, except with a Variation 26. Non enforcement except with variation. Where a plaintiff seeks specific performance of a contract in writing, to which the defendant sets up a variation, the plaintiff cannot obtain the performance sought, except with the variation so set up, in the following cases (namely):__ (a) where by fraud or mistake of fact the contract of which performance is sought is in terms different from that which the defendant supposed it to be when he entered into it ; (b) where by fraud, mistake of fact, or surprise the defendant entered into the contract under a reasonable misapprehension as to its effect as between himself and the plaintiff ; (c) where the defendant, knowing the terms of the contract and understanding its effect, has entered into it relying upon some misrepresentation by the plaintiff, or upon some stipulation on the plaintiff’s part, which adds to the contract, but which he refuses to fulfill ; (d) where the object of the parties was to produce a certain legal result, which the contract as framed is not calculated to produce; Page 22 of 35 (e) where the parties have, subsequently to the execution of the contract, contracted to vary it. Illustrations (a) A, B and C sign a writing by which they purport to contract each to enter into a bond to D for Rs. 1,000. In a suit by D, to make A, B and C separately liable each to the extent of Rs. 1,000, they prove that the word “each” was inserted by mistake; that the intention was that they should give a joint bond for Rs. 1,000. D can obtain the performance sought only with the variation thus set up. (b) A sues B to compel specific performance of a contract in writing to buy a dwelling­house. B proves that he assumed that the contract included an adjoining yard, and the contract was so framed as to leave it doubtful whether the yard was so included or not. The Court will refuse to enforce the contract, except with the variation set up by B. (c) A contracts in writing to let to B a wharf, together with a strip of A’s land delineated in a map. Before signing the contract, B proposed orally that he should be at liberty to substitute for the strip mentioned in the contract another strip of A’s land of the same dimensions, and to this A expressly assented. B then signed the written contract. A cannot obtain specific performance of the written contract, except with the variation set up by B. (d) A and B enter into negotiations for the purpose of securing land for B for his life, with remainder to his issue. They execute a contract, the terms of which are found to confer an absolute ownership on B. The contract so framed cannot be specifically enforced. (e) A contracts in writing to let a house to B, for a certain term, at the rent of Rs. 100 per month, putting it first into tenantable repair. The house turns out to be not worth repairing, so, with B’s consent, A pulls it down and erects a new house in its place: B contracting orally to pay rent at Rs. 120 per mensum. B then sues to enforce specific performance of the contract in writing. He cannot enforce it except with the variations made by the subsequent oral contract. (g) Against whom contracts may be specifically enforced. 27. Relief against parties and persons claiming under them by subsequent title. Except as otherwise provided by this Chapter, specific performance of a contract may be enforced against___ (a) either party thereto; (b) any other person claiming under him by a title arising subsequently to the contract, except a transferee for value who has paid his money in good faith and without notice of the original contract; (c) any person claiming under a title which, though prior to the contract and known to the plaintiff, might have been displaced by the defendant; (d) when a public company has entered into a contract and subsequently becomes Page 23 of 35 amalgamated with another public company, the new company which arises out of the amalgamation; (e) when the promoters of a public company have, before its incorporation, entered into a contract, the company: provided that the company has ratified and adopted the contract and the contract is warranted by the terms of the incorporation. Illustrations to clause (b)___ A contracts to convey certain land to B by a particular day, A dies intestate before that day without having conveyed the land. B may compel A’s heir or other representative in interest to perform the contract specifically. A contracts to sell certain land to B for Rs. 5,000. A afterwards conveys the land for Rs. 6,000 to C, who has notice of the original contract. B may enforce specific performance of the contract as against C. A contracts to sell land to B for Rs. 5,000. B takes possession of the land. Afterwards A sells it to C for Rs. 6,000. C makes no inquiry of B relating to his interest in the land. B’s possession is sufficient to affect C with notice of his interest, and he may enforce specific performance of the contract against C. A contracts, in consideration of Rs. 1,000, to bequeath certain of his lands to B. Immediately after the contract A dies intestate, and C takes out administration to his estate. B may enforce specific performance of the contract against C. A contracts to sell certain land to B. Before the completion of the contract, A becomes a lunatic and C is appointed his committee. B may specifically enforce the contract against C. to clause (c)___ A, the tenant for life of an estate, with remainder to B, in due exercise of a power conferred by the settlement under which he is tenant for life, contracts to sell the estate to C, who has notice of the settlement. Before the sale is completed, A dies. C may enforce specific performance of the contract against B. A and B are joint tenants of land, his undivided moiety of which either may alien in his lifetime, but which, subject to that right, devolves on the survivor. A contracts to sell his moiety to C and dies. C may enforce specific performance of the contract against B. 1[27A. Specific performance in case of part performance of contract to lease. Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, where a contract to lease immoveable property is made in writing signed by the parties thereto or on their behalf, either party may, notwithstanding that the contract, though required to be registered, has not be en registered, sue the other for specific performance of the contract if,___ 1S. 27A ins. by the Transfer of Property (Amdt.) Supplementary Act, 1929 (21 of 1929), s. 3 ( w.e.f . 1st April, 1930). Page 24 of 35 (a) where specific performance is claimed by the lessor, he has delivered possession of the property to the lessee in part performance of the contract; and (b) where specific performance is claimed by the lessee, he has, in part performance of the contract, taken possession of the property, or, being already in possession, continues in possession in part performance of the contract, and has done some act in furtherance of the contract: Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the rights of a transferee for consideration who has no notice of the contract or of the part performance thereof. This section applies to contracts to lease executed after the first day of April, 1930.] (h) Against whom Contracts cannot be specifically enforced 28. What parties cannot be compelled to perform. Specific performance of a contract cannot be enforced against a party thereto in any of the following cases:__ (a) if the consideration to be received by him is so grossly inadequate, with reference to the state of things existing at the date of the contract, as to be either by itself or coupled with other circumstances evidence of fraud or of undue advantage taken by the plaintiff ; (b) if his assent was obtained by the misrepresentation (whether willful or innocent), concealment, circumvention or unfair practices, of any party to whom performance would become due under the contract, or by any promise of such party which has not been substantially fulfilled; (c) if his assent was given under the influence of mistake of fact, misapprehension or surprise: Provided that, when the contract provides for compensation in case of mistake, compensation may be made for a mistake within the scope of such provision, and the contract may be specifically enforced in other respects if proper to be so enforced. Illustrations to clause (c)___ A, one of two executors, in the erroneous belief that he had the authority of his co­executor, enters into an agreement for the sale to B of his testator’s property. B cannot insist on the sale being completed. A directs an auctioneer to sell certain land. A afterwards revokes the auctioneer’s authority as to 20 bighas of this land, but the auctioneer inadvertently sells the whole to B, who has not notice of the revocation. B cannot enforce specific performance of the agreement. (i) The effect of dismissing a Suit for Specific Performance 29. Bar of suit for breach after dismissal. The dismissal of a suit for specific performance of a contract or part thereof shall bar the plaintiff’s right to sue for compensation for the breach of such contract or part, as the case may be. Page 25 of 35 (j) Awards and Directions to execute Settlements 30. Application of preceding sections to awards and testamentary directions to execute settlements. The provisions of this Chapter as to contracts shall, mutatis mutandis , apply to awards and to directions in a will or codicil to execute a particular settlement. ___________ CHAPTER III OF THE RECTIFICATION OF INSTRUMENT 31. When instrument may be rectified. When, through fraud or a mutual mistake of the parties, a contract or other instrument in writing does not truly express their intention, either party, or his representative in interest, may institute a suit to have the instrument rectified; and if the Court find it clearly proved that there has been fraud or mistake in framing the instrument, and ascertain the real intention of the parties in executing the same, the Court may in its discretion rectify the instrument so as to express that intention, so far as this can be done without prejudice to rights acquired by third persons in good faith and for value. Illustrations (a) A, intending to sell to B his house and one of three godowns adjacent to it, executes a conveyance prepared by B, in which, through B’s fraud, all three godowns are included. Of the two godowns which were fraudulently included, B gives one to C and lets the other to D for a rent, neither C nor D having any knowledge of the fraud. The conveyance may, as against B and C, be rectified so as to exclude from it the godown given to C; but it cannot be rectified so as to affect D’s lease. (b) By a marriage settlement, A, the father of B, the intended wife, covenants with C, the intended husband, to pay to C, his executors, administrators and assigns, during A’s life, an annuity of Rs. 5,000. C dies insolvent and the official assignee claims the annuity from A. The Court, on finding it clearly proved that the parties always intended that this annuity should be paid as a provision for B and her children, may rectify the settlement and decree that the assignee has no right to any Part of the annuity. 32. Presumption as to intent of parties. For the purpose of rectifying a contract in writing, the Court must be satisfied that all the parties thereto intended to make an equitable and conscientious agreement. 33. Principles of rectification. In rectifying a written instrument, the Court may inquire what the instrument was intended to mean, and what were intended to be its legal consequences, and is not confined to the inquiry what the language of the instrument was intended to be. 34. Specific enforcement of rectified contract. A contract in writing may be first rectified and then, if the plaintiff has so prayed in his plaint and the Court thinks fit, specifically enforced. Page 26 of 35 Illustration A contracts in writing to pay his attorney, B, a fixed sum in lieu of costs. The contract contains mistakes as to the name and rights of the client, which, if construed strictly, would exclude B from all rights under it. B is entitled, if the Court thinks fit, to have it rectified, and to an order for payment of the sum, as if at the time of its execution it had expressed the intention of the parties. ____________ CHAPTER IV OF THE RESCISSION OF CONTRACTS 35. When rescission may be adjudged. Any person interested in a contract in writing 1may sue to have it rescinded, and such rescission may be adjudged by the Court in any of the following cases, namely:__ (a) where the contract is voidable or terminable by the plaintiff ; (b) where the contract is unlawful for causes not apparent on its face, and the defendant is more to blame than the plaintiff ; (c) where a decree for specific performance of a contract of sale, or of a contract to take a lease, has been made, and the purchaser or lessee makes default in payment of the purchase­money or other sums which the Court has ordered him to pay. When the purchaser or lessee is in possession of the subject­matter, and the Court finds that such possession is wrongful, the Court may also order him to pay to the vendor or lessor the rents and profits, if any, received by him as such possessor. In the same case, the Court may, by order in the suit in which the decree has been made and not complied with, rescind the contract, either so far as regards the party in default, or altogether as the justice of the case may require. Illustrations to (a)___ A sells a field to B. There is a right of way over the field of which A has direct personal knowledge, but which he conceals from B. B is entitled to have the contract rescinded. to (b)___ A, an attorney, induces his client B, a Hindu widow, to transfer property to him, for the purpose of defrauding B’s creditors. Here the parties are not equally in fault, and B is entitled to have the instrument of transfer rescinded. 1The words “in writing” are rep. wherever the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), is in force, see ss. 1 and 2 of that Act. Page 27 of 35 36. Rescission for mistake. Rescission of a contract in writing1 cannot be adjudged for mere mistake, unless the party against whom it is adjudged can be restored to substantially the same position as if the contract had not been made. 37. Alternative prayer for rescission in suit for specific performance. A plaintiff instituting a suit for the specific performance of a contract in writing may pray in the alternative that, if the contract cannot be specifically enforced, it may be rescinded and delivered up to be cancelled; and the Court, if it refuses to enforce the contract specifically, may direct it to be rescinded and delivered up accordingly. 38. Court may require party rescinding to do equity. On adjudging the rescission of a contract, the Court may require the party to whom such relief is granted to make any compensation to the other which justice may require. ___________ CHAPTER V OF THE CANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS 39. When cancellation may be ordered. Any person against whom a written instrument is void or voidable, who has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding, may cause him serious injury, may sue to have it adjudged void or voidable; and the Court may, in its discretion, so adjudge it and order it to be delivered up and cancelled. If the instrument has been registered under the Indian Registration Act2, the Court shall also send a copy of its decree to the officer in whose office the instrument has been so registered; and such officer shall note on the copy of the instrument contained in his books the fact of its cancellation. Illustrations (a) A, the owner of a ship by fraudulently representing her to be seaworthy, induces B, an underwriter, to insure her. B may obtain the cancellation of the policy. (b) A conveys land to B, who bequeaths it to C and dies. Thereupon D gets possession of the land and produces a forged instrument stating that the conveyance was made to B in trust for him. C may obtain the cancellation of the forged instrument. (c) A, representing that the tenants on his land were all at will, sells it to B, and conveys it to him by an instrument, dated the 1st January 1877. Soon after that day, A fraudulently grants to C a lease of part of the lands, dated the 1st October, 1876, and procures the lease to be registered under the Indian Registration Act.3 B may obtain the cancellation of this lease. 1The words “in writing” are rep. wherever the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), is in force, see ss. 1 and 2 of that Act. 2See now the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908). 3See now the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908). Page 28 of 35 (d) A agrees to sell and deliver a ship to B, to be paid for by B’s acceptances of four bills of exchange, for sums amounting to Rs, 30,000 to be drawn by A on B. The bills are drawn and accepted, but the ship is not delivered according to the agreement. A sues B on one of the bills, B may obtain the cancellation of all the bills. 40. What instruments may be partially cancelled. Where an instrument is evidence of different rights or different obligations, the Court may, in a proper case, cancel it in part and allow it to stand for the residue. Illustration A draws a bill on B, who endorses it to C, by whom it appears to be endorsed to D, who endorses it to E. C’s endorsement is forged. C is entitled to have such endorsement cancelled, leaving the bill to stand in other respects. 41. Power to require party for whom instrument is cancelled to make compensation. On adjudging the cancellation of an instrument, the Court may require the party to whom such relief is granted to make any compensation to the other which justice may require. _________ CHAPTER VI OF DECLARATORY DECREES 1[42. Discretion of Court as to declaration of status or right .— (1) Any person entitled to any character, or any right to any property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or interested to deny, his title to such character or right, and the Court may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is so entitled and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any further relief: Provided that no Court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, being able to seek further re lief than a mere declaration of title, omits to do so. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, a suit filed under sub -section (1) shall be decided by the Court within six months and the appellate court shall decide the appeal not later than ninety days, as the case may b e.] 43. Effect of declaration. A declaration made under this Chapter is binding only on the parties to the suit, persons claiming through them respectively, and, where any of the parties are trustees, on the persons for whom, if in existence at the date of the declaration, such parties would be trustees. Illustration A, a Hindu, in a suit to which B, his alleged wife, and her mother, are defendants, seeks a declaration that his marriage was duly solemnized and an order for the restitution of his conjugal rights. The Court makes the declaration and order. C, claiming that B is his wife, then sues A for the recovery of B. The declaration made in the former suit is not binding upon C. 1Subs., by Act XXXIII of 2023, s.2. Page 29 of 35 CHAPTER VII OF THE APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVERS 44. Appointment of receivers discretionary. The appointment of a receiver pending a suit is a matter resting in the discretion of the Court. Reference to Code of Civil Procedure. The mode and effect of his appointment, and his rights, powers duties and liabilities, are regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure1. CHAPTER VIII. ____ [Of the Enforcement of Public Duties.] Omitted by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration ) Ordinance, 1981 (XXVII of 1981), s. 3 and IInd Sch. PART III Of Preventive Relief ___________ CHAPTER IX OF INJUNCTIONS GENERALLY 52. Preventive relief how granted. Preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the Court by injunction, temporary or perpetual. 53. Temporary injunctions. Temporary injunctions are such as are to continue until a specified time, or until the further order of the Court. They may be granted at any period of a suit, and are regulated by the 2[Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908 ).] Perpetual Injunctions. A perpetual injunction can only be granted by the decree made at the hearing and upon the merits of the suit: the defendant is thereby perpetually enjoined from the assertion of a right, or from the commission of an act, which would be contrary to the rights of the plaintiff. _____________ CHAPTER X OF PERPETUAL INJUNCTIONS 54. Perpetual injunctions when granted. Subject to the other provisions contained in, or referred to by, this Chapter, a perpetual injunction may be granted to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in favour of the applicant, whether expressly or by implication. When such obligation arises from contract, the Court shall be guided by the rules and provisions contained in Chapter II of this Act. When the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff’s right to, or enjoyment of, property, the Court may grant a perpetual injunction in the following cases (namely):__ (a) where the defendant is trustee of the property for the plaintiff ; 1See now the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act 5 of 1908). 2Subs. by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration) Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s. 3 and 2nd Sch., for “Code of Civil Proc edure”. Page 30 of 35 (b) where there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused, or likely to be caused, by the invasion; (c) where the invasion is such that pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief; (d) where it is probable that pecuniary compensation can not be got for the invasion; (e) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings.

Page 35 of 35 (b) A contracts to sell to B the good­will of a business. A then sets up a similar business close by B’s shop and solicits his old customers to deal with him. This is contrary to his implied contract, and B may obtain an injunction to restrain A from soliciting the customers, and from doing any act whereby their good­will may be withdrawn from B. (c) A contracts with B to sing for twelve months at B’s theatre and not to sing in public elsewhere. B cannot obtain specific performance of the contract to sing, but he is entitled to an injunction restraining A from singing at any other place of public entertainment. (d) B contracts with A that he will serve him faithfully for twelve months as a clerk. A is not entitled to a decree for specific performance of the contract. But he is entitled to an injunction restraining B from serving a rival house as clerk.
